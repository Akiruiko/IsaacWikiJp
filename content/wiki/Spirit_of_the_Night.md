 # Spirit of the Night ![image](/image/Spirit_of_the_Night.png) 


Effects
---------


* Grants [spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears") and [flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight").
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Leviathan](/wiki/Leviathan "Leviathan") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Leviathan.


Notes
-------


* The changed texture of the player's body is the same as  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost")'s, but recolored.
* [![image](/image/Lord_of_the_Pit.png)](/wiki/Lord_of_the_Pit "Lord of the Pit") [Lord of the Pit](/wiki/Lord_of_the_Pit "Lord of the Pit") costs the same amount of Red Hearts as Spirit of the Night, while only granting flight and increased speed. ItÂ´s strongly recommended to take Spirit of the Night over Lord of the Pit if presented with both of these.
