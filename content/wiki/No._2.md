Effects[]
---------


* Continuously firing tears for 3 seconds causes Isaac to drop a free [(Butt Bombs)](/wiki/Butt_Bombs "Butt Bombs") [Butt Bombs](/wiki/Butt_Bombs "Butt Bombs") bomb. Only 1 Butt Bomb can be dropped per charging cycle, so it is required to stop firing and then charge again to drop another Butt Bomb. Taking Damage will interrupt the cycle.
	+ More precisely, a bomb is dropped by holding any fire button/direction for 3 seconds, and as such the effect is also triggered by charging or directly controlled attacks.
	+ (Added in Repentance) There is a visual fart effect whenever a Butt Bomb is placed.
* (Added in Repentance) This item belongs to the [Oh Crap](/wiki/Oh_Crap "Oh Crap") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a walking pile of poop.


Notes[]
-------


* Essentially grants unlimited bombs, as the charge time can be repeatedly reset to bomb tinted rocks and to get into [Secret](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") and [Super Secret](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room") Rooms.
* Increases difficulty of poop-themed bosses such as [Dingle](/wiki/Dingle "Dingle"), as Butt Bombs restore 25% of maximum HP to the bosses when they explode.
* The spawned butt bombs will be affected by bomb modifiers, excluding [(Mr. Mega)](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") [Mr. Mega](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega").


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Remote Detonator)](/wiki/Remote_Detonator "Remote Detonator") [Remote Detonator](/wiki/Remote_Detonator "Remote Detonator"): Bombs placed by Number Two will not explode until Remote Detonator is activated.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Ring Cap)](/wiki/Ring_Cap "Ring Cap") [Ring Cap](/wiki/Ring_Cap "Ring Cap"): Only 1 bomb is placed by Number Two.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Short Fuse)](/wiki/Short_Fuse "Short Fuse") [Short Fuse](/wiki/Short_Fuse "Short Fuse"): No effect.
