Effects
---------


* (Removed in Afterbirth †) Randomly increases at least 1 and decreases 1-3 of Isaac's [stats](/wiki/Attributes "Attributes"). The same stats can be increased/decreased multiple times.
* (Added in Afterbirth †) Randomly increases 4 and decreases 2 of Isaac's [stats](/wiki/Attributes "Attributes").
* Each increase or decrease for a stat will change it by a fixed value:
	+ ±1 [health](/wiki/Health "Health").
	+ ±1 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
	+ ±0.5 [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears").
	+ (Removed in Repentance) ±0.5 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
	+ (Added in Repentance) ±1.5 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
	+ ±0.2 [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed").
	+ ±0.2 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed").
		- (Removed in Repentance) Also affects maximum speed (may never exceed 2.0).
	+ ±1 [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").
* If a stat that is already at an upper or lower limit is chosen, there is no visible effect.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Spun](/wiki/Spun "Spun") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a buff berserker.


Notes
-------


The stat changes are permanent and will not go away if the item is removed.



* (Added in Repentance) This makes the item especially useful for  [(Tainted Isaac)](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac"), since he gets to keep the stats while having the option to switch Experimental Treatment for another item and the transformation progress isn't lost in the process.


(Added in Repentance) The tears up from this item is allowed to go past the normal tear cap of 5.0. However if it decreases tears, the normal tear cap will also be decreased.
