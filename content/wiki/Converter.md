Effects
---------


* On use, spawns a wisp that orbits Isaac and fires small [spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears") alongside him. The wisps can block shots and deals contact damage to enemies, but take damage when doing so and will be destroyed when enough damage is taken.
	+ When a wisp is destroyed, the sound of fire being extinguished plays.
		- A normal wisp is white and blue, has 2 health and spectral tears which deal 1.6-2.4 damage, and is summoned in the middle ring.
		- A wisp's health can be represented by its size, shrinking as its health decreases.
		- Most wisps deal contact damage equal to 2x Isaac's damage. Doing damage this way usually destroys the wisp unless Isaac is [invulnerable](/wiki/Temporary_Buffs "Temporary Buffs").
	+ Multiple wisps can exist at once. Some combinations have an upper limit of 26 wisps: an inner counterclockwise ring of 6, a middle clockwise ring with 8, and an outer counterclockwise ring of 12.
* If another active item is picked up, Book of Virtues will become a passive item that causes active items to spawn wisps when used, often with [special effects](/wiki/Wisps.xml "Wisps.xml").
* While held, changes the first (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") encountered to be an (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room"), and increases the chance of an Angel Room appearing by 12.5%.
	+ Allows for Angel Rooms to appear even if a Deal with the Devil was taken before.
* This item belongs to the [Bookworm](/wiki/Bookworm "Bookworm") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Bookworm.


Notes
-------


* [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") starts with this item.
* It is the only passive item in the [library pool](/wiki/Library_(Item_Pool) "Library (Item Pool)").
	+ If Isaac walks into a library for the first time with [(NO!)](/wiki/NO! "NO!") [NO!](/wiki/NO! "NO!"), The Book of Virtues is very likely to appear.
	+ Because of this, when acquired from a library the book cannot be rerolled by use of the [![image](/image/D4.png)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4"), [![image](/image/D100.png)](/wiki/D100 "D100") [D100](/wiki/D100 "D100"), a (Dice Room) [Dice Room](/wiki/Dice_Room "Dice Room"), or getting hit as  [(Tainted Eden)](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden") [Tainted Eden](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden").
* Whenever Isaac is [invulnerable](/wiki/Temporary_Buffs "Temporary Buffs") the wisps are as well, but can still deal damage.
* Summoning a wisp while at the maximum will replace the most damaged wisp.
* While having 100% chance of (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") discovery, Isaac will not get teleported to a (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") by using some items which allow it. Instead, he will be teleported to the Angel Room, keeping his 100% chance of discovering Angel Room. This can be used to get to Angel Room on the first floor, where naturally Devil/Angel Rooms do not spawn, and still keep the 100% chance for the next floor.
* This item's passive effects also apply to active items in the consumable slot. (e.g.  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany")'s [![image](/image/Lemegeton.png)](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") [Lemegeton](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton"),  [(Tainted Jacob)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") [Tainted Jacob](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob")'s [![image](/image/Anima_Sola.png)](/wiki/Anima_Sola "Anima Sola") [Anima Sola](/wiki/Anima_Sola "Anima Sola"), etc.)
* While the item can function as both passive and active item, it is treated as a passive item by [(NO!)](/wiki/NO! "NO!") [NO!](/wiki/NO! "NO!"), [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void") and [(XVII - The Stars?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XVII - The Stars?") [XVII - The Stars?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes").
* This item is displayed in the Extra HUD as a passive item.
	+ It will take up one of  [(Tainted Isaac)](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac")'s limited item slots.


Synergies
-----------


* [(Baby-Bender)](/wiki/Baby-Bender "Baby-Bender") [Baby-Bender](/wiki/Baby-Bender "Baby-Bender"): Wisps gain homing tears.
* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Increases the tear size and doubles the damage of Wisps.
* [(Butter!)](/wiki/Butter! "Butter!") [Butter!](/wiki/Butter! "Butter!") / [('M)](/wiki/%27M "'M") ['M](/wiki/%27M "'M"): Can be used to remove the Book of Virtues as long as Isaac isn't holding a different active item.
* [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Doubles the spawned wisps on activation.
* [![image](/image/Tear_Detonator.png)](/wiki/Tear_Detonator "Tear Detonator") [Tear Detonator](/wiki/Tear_Detonator "Tear Detonator"): The wisps' tears are also detonated; the resulting tears are based on Isaac's own, rather than the wisps'.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Analog_Stick.png)](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick") [Analog Stick](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick"): Wisps are unable to shoot diagonally, and will shoot up or downwards instead.
* [![image](/image/Lodestone.png)](/wiki/Lodestone "Lodestone") [Lodestone](/wiki/Lodestone "Lodestone"): The wisps' tears are attracted to the magnetic enemy, making it much easier to connect all of the wisps' tears on an enemy.
* [(NO!)](/wiki/NO! "NO!") [NO!](/wiki/NO! "NO!"): Will not prevent Book of Virtues from spawning, as it's considered a passive item.
* [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): The Book of Virtues is considered to be a purely passive item, so only stat boosts will be gained by using Void on it. Further uses of the Void will not have the Book's effects.
* [(XVII - The Stars?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XVII - The Stars?") [XVII - The Stars?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Book of Virtues will be removed if it's the oldest collected item, even if another active item is not being held.
