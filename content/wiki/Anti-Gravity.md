 # Anti-Gravity ![image](/image/Anti-Gravity.png) 


Effects
---------


* Holding the fire buttons causes tears to hover in midair. When released, the tears will all shoot in the direction they were originally fired.
	+ If the fire buttons are not released, the tears will fire on their own after 3 seconds.


* -2 [tear delay](/wiki/Tear_delay "Tear delay") (increased rate of fire)
	+ Since this directly affects tear delay instead of changing the tears stat, it allows Isaac's rate of fire to go over the normal maximum rate.
	+ Tear delay decreases are more noticeable and are a greater increase to DPS when the tears stat is high.


  




Notes
-------


* Gravitational effects, such as [(Mega Fatty)](/wiki/Mega_Fatty "Mega Fatty") [Mega Fatty](/wiki/Mega_Fatty "Mega Fatty")'s inhalation or a [(Gaping Maw)](/wiki/Stone_Grimace#Gaping_Maw "Gaping Maw") [Gaping Maw](/wiki/Stone_Grimace#Gaping_Maw "Stone Grimace") will pull floating tears toward them.
* The [range](/wiki/Range "Range") attribute only affects the lifespan of the tears after they have been released.
* Hovering tears can damage monsters like [(Knight)](/wiki/Knight "Knight") [Knights](/wiki/Knight "Knight") or [(Mask of Infamy)](/wiki/Mask_of_Infamy "Mask of Infamy") [Mask of Infamy](/wiki/Mask_of_Infamy "Mask of Infamy") from the front, even if they don't have the [piercing effect](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears").

* [![image](/image/Proptosis.png)](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") [Proptosis](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis"): The tears will not decrease in size or damage until they start moving, making this excellent against enemies that chase Isaac.
