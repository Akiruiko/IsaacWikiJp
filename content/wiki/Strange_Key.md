 # Strange Key ![image](/image/Strange_Key.png) 

Effects
---------


* Unlocks the passageway to [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)"), regardless of run duration.
* If [(Pandora's Box)](/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box "Pandora's Box") [Pandora's Box](/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box "Pandora's Box") is used while holding Strange Key, the following effects will occur instead of Pandora's Box regular effects:
	+ The normal effect of Pandora's Box for that level is ignored, and instead 6 generally higher quality [items](/wiki/Item "Item") from a set of item pools are spawned.
	+ Both Pandora's Box and the trinket are consumed.


Notes
-------


* The items are chosen from the following [item pools](/wiki/Item_pool "Item pool"): Treasure Room, Shop, Boss, Devil, Angel, Secret Room, Library, Golden Chest, Curse Room and Planetarium.
	+ The Treasure Room item pool has a much higher chance to be chosen while the others have an equal chance.
* Both effects work even if the key has been turned into a passive item from items such as [(Smelter)](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") or [(Marbles)](/wiki/Marbles "Marbles") [Marbles](/wiki/Marbles "Marbles").
	+ Using Pandora's Box with the key in this state will remove the key from Isaac's Inventory.
* If playing with modal characters such as  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus"), the character with the Strange Key must enter the room while holding it to cause the passage to open. Leaving and re-entering the room after switching to the correct character will open the door normally.
* Unlike with [(Mama Mega!)](/wiki/Mama_Mega! "Mama Mega!") [Mama Mega!](/wiki/Mama_Mega! "Mama Mega!"), [(Mom's Heart)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") / [(It Lives)](/wiki/It_Lives "It Lives") [It Lives](/wiki/It_Lives "It Lives") must be beaten for the passageway to [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)") to open.
