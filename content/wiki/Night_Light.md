 # Night Light ![image](/image/Night_Light.png) 


Effects
---------


* A cone of light shines from Isaac's chest that slows all enemies and enemy shots.
	+ The light will face the direction Isaac is moving.
	+ The light doesn't affect [bosses](/wiki/Boss "Boss"), but it will slow their shots.
	+ The slow effect will disappear from enemies when the light stops shining on them, but shots will remain slow.
* Removes [Curse of Darkness](/wiki/Curse_of_Darkness "Curse of Darkness") for the current floor.
	+ Doesn't provide immunity on later floors, but lessens the visual effect significantly, effectively removing the curse.


Notes
-------


* The light only needs to touch a shot once to slow it permanently.
	+ Doing a quick circular motion is effective to slow surrounding enemy shots, especially while fighting [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush").
	+ Overuse of this effect can cause unavoidable patterns, as the slowed shots will often still travel most of their original distance.
* (Added in Repentance) This item is **not recommended** against [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast"), as the fires spawned by her will be slowed down significantly and pile up quickly, leading to no room to dodge.
* (Added in Repentance) Doesn't remove Curse of Darkness afflicted by (Added in Repentance)[(XIX - The Sun?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XIX - The Sun?") [XIX - The Sun?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), no matter if Night Light was picked up before or after using the card.
