 # Larynx ![image](/image/Larynx.png) 


Effects
---------


* Upon picking up enough [heart pickups](/wiki/Hearts "Hearts"), Isaac gains a permanent angelic [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") and generates a Soul Heart drop. Possible familiars include:
	+ [![image](/image/Holy_Water.png)](/wiki/Holy_Water "Holy Water") [Holy Water](/wiki/Holy_Water "Holy Water")
	+ [![image](/image/Guardian_Angel.png)](/wiki/Guardian_Angel "Guardian Angel") [Guardian Angel](/wiki/Guardian_Angel "Guardian Angel")
	+ [![image](/image/Sworn_Protector.png)](/wiki/Sworn_Protector "Sworn Protector") [Sworn Protector](/wiki/Sworn_Protector "Sworn Protector")
	+ [![image](/image/The_Relic.png)](/wiki/The_Relic "The Relic") [The Relic](/wiki/The_Relic "The Relic")
	+ [![image](/image/Seraphim.png)](/wiki/Seraphim "Seraphim") [Seraphim](/wiki/Seraphim "Seraphim")
* All five familiars will spawn in a random order, each after collecting 15 hearts.
* After all familiars have been spawned, a [Soul Heart](/wiki/Hearts#Soul_Heart "Hearts") will still drop every 15 hearts collected.
* Isaac will look progressively more pregnant as he collects heart pickups.


Notes
-------


* All types of hearts except [Gold Hearts](/wiki/Gold_Heart "Gold Heart") and [Blended Hearts](/wiki/Blended_Heart "Blended Heart") count.
* Items that directly add health such as [![image](/image/Yum_Heart.png)](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart") [Yum Heart](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart"), [![image](/image/Book_of_Revelations.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Revelations "Book of Revelations") [Book of Revelations](/wiki/Book_of_Revelations "Book of Revelations"), [![image](/image/Satanic_Bible.png)](/wiki/Satanic_Bible "Satanic Bible") [Satanic Bible](/wiki/Satanic_Bible "Satanic Bible"), and [![image](/image/The_Nail.png)](/wiki/The_Nail "The Nail") [The Nail](/wiki/The_Nail "The Nail") do not count towards spawning a familiar.
* Only one of each type of familiar can be spawned.
* [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") can pick up Soul Hearts and Black Hearts despite having no health and thus can activate Immaculate Conception.
* [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") cannot encounter hearts, thus the item is useless for him.
* As the short-lived Half Red Hearts dropped by  [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") also count, it is an excellent choice for her since she will constantly be picking up hearts and gain all five familiars quickly.
* The familiars spawned by Immaculate Conception will still spawn even if Isaac has already obtained the familiar through their respective pedestal item.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/The_Jar.png)](/wiki/The_Jar "The Jar") [The Jar](/wiki/The_Jar "The Jar"): Hearts collected in the jar do not count towards activation.
