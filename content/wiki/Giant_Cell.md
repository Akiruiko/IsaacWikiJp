Effects[]
---------


* Whenever Isaac takes damage, he summons a micro-Isaac familiar, known as Minisaac, that chases nearby enemies and attacks on its own.
	+ Minisaacs deal 1.35 base damage that scales with +0.15 per floor: `damage = 1.35 + 0.15 * (floor - 1)`
	+ Minisaacs shoot 3 tears per second and their tear delay is not affected by Isaac's stats.
	+ Minisaacs persists between rooms and floors.
	+ Each Minisaac is spawned with 15 health points that are constantly drained with a rate of 0.4 per second. The draining stops when they reach 0.8 HP.
		- They are healed back to full HP whenever Isaac takes damage, even when the familiars cap is reached.
	+ Enemies can damage Minisaacs by shooting projectiles at them or dealing contact damage.
		- Isaac's bomb explosions will also damage the familiars.
		- Minisaacs are immune to spikes and lasers.


Notes[]
-------


* The familiar cap for Giant Cell is 16, after which taking damage will not spawn a new Minisaac.
* Minisaacs will change their skin color based on the character that they were spawned from.
	+ Certain items that change skin color can also affect the familiars' appearance.
* When playing as  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"), the familiars take the style as either The Soul or The Forgotten, depending on who gets hit.
	+ If the familiar takes the style of The Forgotten, it will also inherit its bone club attack, dealing 8.1 base damage that scales with +0.9 per floor. It will swing its bone club 1.5 times per second.
* Minisaacs for  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") will spawn from The Forgotten's body and inherit its skin color but they will shoot regular tears.
* Familiars spawned for  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") or  [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") will not inherit the [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") laser and will fire regular tears.
* If Isaac has any form of flight, the Minisaacs will receive wings and will be able to fly as well.
	+ Minisaacs spawned before flight was acquired will not get upgraded, unless the flight is acquired by killing [Dogma](/wiki/Dogma "Dogma") and starting [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") fight in which case they will get upgraded.
* There's an unused Shadow-like minisaac that looks like it should be spawned from  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas"), but this isn't the case.
