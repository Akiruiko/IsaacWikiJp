Effects[]
---------


* Mimics the effect of Isaac's held [pill](/wiki/Pill "Pill"), like [(Blank Card)](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") [Blank Card](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") does with [cards](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Cards "Cards and Runes") and (Added in Repentance)[(Clear Rune)](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune") [Clear Rune](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune") does with [runes](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Runes "Cards and Runes").
	+ Does not consume Isaac's held pill.
	+ Does not mimic cards or runes.


### Recharge time (Added in Repentance)[]


In Repentance, Placebo's recharge time changes depending on the pill Isaac was holding when he used it. This is a list of the following recharge times the item can have:



* **1 Room**:
	+ Bad Gas
	+ Bombs are Key
	+ Feels like I'm walking on sunshine!
	+ Friends Till The End!
	+ Horf!
	+ I Found Pills
	+ Puberty
	+ Something's Wrong...
	+ Telepills
	+ X-Lax
* **2 Rooms**:
	+ Bad Trip
	+ Infested?
	+ Infested!
	+ Percs!
	+ Pheromones
	+ Re-Lax
* **3 Rooms**:
	+ Experimental Pill
	+ Explosive Diarrhea
	+ I'm Drowsy...
	+ Lemon Party
	+ Power Pill!
* **4 Rooms**:
	+ Gulp!
	+ I can see forever!
	+ Stat-downs (health, range, speed, tears, luck, shot speed)
* **6 Rooms**:
	+ ???
	+ Addicted!
	+ Amnesia
	+ Hematemesis
	+ I'm Excited!!!
	+ One makes you larger
	+ One makes you small
	+ Paralysis
	+ Pretty Fly
	+ R U A Wizard?
	+ Retro Vision
	+ Vurp!
	+ Stat-ups (health, range, speed, tears, luck, shot speed)
* **12 Rooms**:
	+ 48 Hour Energy
	+ Balls of Steel
	+ Full Health


Golden Pills use the recharge time of the pill they mimicked. Recharge time is unaffected by whether or not it was a normal pill or Horse Pill.


Note that because the recharge time is determined after using the pill, Placebo cannot be used as a way to narrow down what type of pill Isaac is holding before he uses it.



Synergies[]
-----------


* (Removed in Repentance) [48 Hour Energy](/wiki/Pills#Pill_Effects "Pills"): Can spawn an unlimited number of [Lil' Batteries](/wiki/Batteries "Batteries"), allowing unlimited use of another activated item or pill.
* (Removed in Repentance) [Balls of Steel](/wiki/Pills#Pill_Effects "Pills") + [(Sharp Plug)](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug") [Sharp Plug](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug"): The player can gain functional invincibility.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) [(The Wafer)](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer") [The Wafer](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer"): Allows for Virtually infinite health.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns white wisps on the middle ring. The wisps spawn [Pills](/wiki/Pill "Pill") when destroyed. The effects of the wisps and types of pills they spawn is independent from Placebo's charge time and the most recently used pill. Unlike [(Blank Card)](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") [Blank Card](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") and [(Clear Rune)](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune") [Clear Rune](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune"), enemies killed by these wisps' tears do not have a chance to drop pills.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Butter!)](/wiki/Butter! "Butter!") [Butter!](/wiki/Butter! "Butter!"): Because Placebo is dropped upon usage, the recharge time is reset to 4, allowing to use more expensive pills much more frequently.
* (Added in Repentance) [Vurp](/wiki/Pills#Pill_Effects "Pills"): Allows pills that normally take 12 rooms for Placebo to charge to be used twice as frequently.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Starter Deck)](/wiki/Starter_Deck "Starter Deck") [Starter Deck](/wiki/Starter_Deck "Starter Deck"): All pills are replaced by cards, rendering Placebo useless.
* If used with  [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") or  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany"), using a pill that has a larger charge requirement than Placebo's current will still consume soul or blood charges equal to the difference (likely a bug).
