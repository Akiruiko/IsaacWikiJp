 # Ipecac ![image](/image/Ipecac.png) 

Effects
---------


* Replaces tears with explosive and [poisoning](/wiki/Poison "Poison") projectiles fired in an arc.
* Tears down - (Delay * 2) + 10
* (Removed in Repentance) +13 Shot Height
* +40 flat damage (See [Effective Damage](/wiki/Damage#Effective_Damage "Damage"))
* Tear size multiplier: 0.4x
* (Added in Repentance) -0.2 [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed").
* (Added in Repentance) Minor range down.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Bob](/wiki/Bob "Bob") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Bob.


Notes
-------


* Enemies within the blast radius of an Ipecac explosion will also be [poisoned](/wiki/Poison "Poison").
* The damage boost mitigates the very small tear size multiplier.
* Ipecac's damage bonus does not apply to [Burn](/wiki/Burn "Burn") or [Poison](/wiki/Poison "Poison") fully; only (Removed in Repentance)+4/(Added in Repentance)+2 is applied to their damage per tick.
* Character damage multipliers do not apply to Ipecac's flat bonus.
* Since explosions that deal less than 85 damage hurt Isaac for half a heart, Ipecac shots usually hurt Isaac for half a heart.
	+ Self-damage is increased to a full heart with 85 or higher damage stat.
* Explosions that deal more than or equal to 166 damage shake the screen.
* (Added in Repentance) The tear height of the shots scales with range. At base stats, Ipecac shots won't be able to fly over obstacles, but the more range ups Isaac gets, the higher shots will be launched.
* (Added in Repentance) It is possible that with low shot speed and high range/tear height, Isaac won't be able to hit obstacles up close with Ipecac shots.
* (Removed in Repentance) The range of the explosion is a circle roughly 3 blocks in diameter, regardless of damage.
	+ As Ipecac's explosion range does not scale with tear size, with enough tear size increasing items (e.g. [![image](/image/Death%27s_Touch.png)](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch") [Death's Touch](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch")), it can become nearly impossible to hit enemies with Ipecac's explosions.
* (Added in Repentance) Ipecac's explosion range increases with tear size.
* Using Ipecac in a Crawl Space will cause the tear to bounce off the ceiling, bounce off the floor at a low height, and eventually explode. The same applies to using it on a Crawl Space wall.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Brain Worm)](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm") [Brain Worm](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm"): The Ipecac tears will snap 90 degrees and rain down at nearby enemy should the shot miss, completely eliminating the shortcoming of having too much range and causing Ipecac tears to fly over enemy's head, missing them.
* [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") /  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel"): Blood beam now does poison damage and will explode on connection with an enemy which can damage the character if close enough. The character doesn't gain the Damage Up or Tears Down effects.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) Isaac shoots Ipecac tears while charging Brimstone. Both Brimstone and Ipecac shots modify Isaac's damage and tear delay stat, meaning that Ipecac fires slower and Brimstone charges slower, but Brimstone does an extra 40*13 damage. Take care to pre-charge Brimstone so that the Ipecac shot is on cooldown as Isaac enters a room.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The flat damage bonus is reduced to +2, but Isaac's tear rate stat is not modified. The beam explodes on the first enemy or obstacle it hits every other tick, dealing 10 + twice of Isaac's Damage. The explosions do not occur when the beam narrows, meaning that they occur only twice per shot without [![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") / (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Almond_Milk.png)](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk") [Almond Milk](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk"). The beam and its explosions poison enemies.

The flat damage bonus is reduced to +2. With [Jacob & Esau](/wiki/Jacob_%26_Esau "Jacob & Esau") only the character with the items is immune to the explosions.

* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Flat_Stone.png)](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone") [Flat Stone](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone"): The Ipecac shots cause full-damage explosions instead of lesser splash damage when they bounce off the floor, though they can also harm Isaac.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Each bounce creates an explosion that deals half Isaac's damage as well as dealing the regular splash damage. The bounce explosion radius is slightly larger than the splash radius.
* (Added in Afterbirth †) [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): The flat damage bonus is reduced to +4.

* [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): Charged up Ipecac deals expectedly high damage. Rapid-fire can be used against weaker enemies or to clear obstacles when necessary.

* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Death%27s_Touch.png)](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch") [Death's Touch](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch"): Although damage is increased, the tears' hitboxes also grow larger which may be detrimental.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Tears are no longer ridiculously big. Much safer to use.
* [![image](/image/Fire_Mind.png)](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind") [Fire Mind](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind"): Due to the nature of the Ipecac, all shots will have a 100% chance of leaving a fire at the center of the explosion. (Removed in Repentance) It will also no longer leave behind green creep and the explosion will be of normal color instead of green.
* (Removed in Repentance) (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Ghost_Pepper.png)](/wiki/Ghost_Pepper "Ghost Pepper") [Ghost Pepper](/wiki/Ghost_Pepper "Ghost Pepper"): If a fire is generated at the same time as an Ipecac shot, the Ipecac shot will explode instantly.

* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Glass_Cannon.png)](/wiki/Glass_Cannon "Glass Cannon") [Glass Cannon](/wiki/Glass_Cannon "Glass Cannon"): As the Glass Cannon tears are so large, even a modest damage increase or a single tear size increasing item is likely to render the tear unable to damage enemies.

	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Ipecac shots spawn Blue Flies on hit, both direct and indirect.

* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Little_Horn_(Item).png)](/wiki/Little_Horn_(Item) "Little Horn") [Little Horn](/wiki/Little_Horn_(Item) "Little Horn (Item)"): If an Ipecac shot has the Little Horn effect, after destroying an enemy, it loses its explosive property and effectively is just a normal Little Horn tear.
* [![image](/image/Lost_Contact.png)](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact") [Lost Contact](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact"): Ipecac shots will explode on contact with enemy shots.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Eye.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye") [Mom's Eye](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye") / [![image](/image/Loki%27s_Horns.png)](/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns "Loki's Horns") [Loki's Horns](/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns "Loki's Horns"): Occasionally shoots backwards or in all 4 directions, with high risk of self-damage.
* [Piercing tears](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears"): Tears will still explode on enemy contact, nullifying piercing.
* [![image](/image/Rubber_Cement.png)](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement") [Rubber Cement](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement"): Tears will bounce off walls and rocks and won't explode until they hit the ground. Not recommended, as self-damage is likely.
* [Spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears"): Ipecac shots no longer explode on contact with obstacles or walls, making accidental self-damage less likely but it's more difficult to open secret doors.
* [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"): Tainted Forgotten's melee attacks will explode. Tainted Soul is immune *only* to those explosions, and any further explosions caused by synergies will damage it.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Technology_2.png)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2"): The +40 damage bonus is not affected by the Technology 2 multiplier making the laser very high powered, but only every other Ipecac shot is fired.

* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Technology_Zero.png)](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero") [Technology Zero](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero"): High fire rate needed for explosive shots to be connected.
* [![image](/image/Tiny_Planet.png)](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") [Tiny Planet](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet"): Ipecac tears orbit around Isaac for a very long time. They land far enough to not cause self-damage, but that can be relied on only if Isaac is not moving and do not hit enemies.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Tractor_Beam.png)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): The Ipecac tear will travel in an arc along the beam, even if Isaac is moving forward as well. When Isaac changes direction, the tear will snap to the beam, making it very easy to accidentally hit close objects blocking its new path.
