 # Wavy Cap ![image](/image/Wavy_Cap.png) 


Effects
---------


* A beam appears directly in front of Isaac in the direction that his head is facing. Isaac's tears travel in the path of the beam.
	+ When Isaac moves or turns his head, tears that are mid-flight will snap to the beam.
* (Removed in Repentance)+0.5 [Tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears").
	+ (Added in Repentance) +1.0 [Fire Rate](/wiki/Fire_Rate "Fire Rate").
* (Removed in Repentance) +5.25 [Range](/wiki/Range "Range").
	+ (Added in Repentance) +1.5 [Range](/wiki/Range "Range").
* +0.16 [Shot Speed](/wiki/Shot_Speed "Shot Speed").
* +0.5 [Tear Height](/wiki/Tear_Height "Tear Height").


Notes
-------


* This item prevents Isaac from firing tears at angles using momentum.
* Having this item equipped prevents Isaac from automatically aiming downwards after he stops firing.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") / [![image](/image/The_Parasite.png)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): All split tears will follow the beam.
* [Conjoined](/wiki/Conjoined "Conjoined") transformation: The 2 split shots will instead follow the beam, making it easier to hit enemies with. Essentially increases damage per second.
* [![image](/image/Continuum.png)](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum") [Continuum](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum"): The tears will re-appear directly in front of Isaac and continue their flight path after going off screen.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Lachryphagy.png)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Tears can still be fed and will still burst. (Removed in Repentance) Burst tears will travel along the beam.
* [![image](/image/Monstro%27s_Lung.png)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"): All tears are fired along the beam but at different heights.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Pop!.png)](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") [Pop!](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!"): Tears stick along the tractor beam even when they slow down and collide, capable of creating a dense line of shots.
* [![image](/image/Rubber_Cement.png)](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement") [Rubber Cement](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement") / (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Super Ball)](/wiki/Super_Ball "Super Ball") [Super Ball](/wiki/Super_Ball "Super Ball"): Tears will no longer be bound to the beam after bouncing off of something.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Sinus_Infection.png)](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") [Sinus Infection](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection"): Once the booger falls off the enemy, Isaac can loosely control it by moving and firing in different directions, and make it stick to another enemy.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Sumptorium.png)](/wiki/Sumptorium "Sumptorium") [Sumptorium](/wiki/Sumptorium "Sumptorium"): Tears shot by blood clots will follow the beam.


Interactions
--------------


* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Analog_Stick.png)](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick") [Analog Stick](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick"): Tears cannot be fired diagonally; however, stat effects apply.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Tractor Beam can be angled diagonally or in any direction using an analog stick or mouse controls.
* [![image](/image/Anti-Gravity.png)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): Tears that are still hovering can be pushed in the direction Isaac is aiming by walking into them.
* [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Overridden by Brimstone. Stat effects apply.
* [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): After firing a bomb and moving, the bomb will have a homing-style effect towards the beam, but will not stay directly on the beam. **Not recommended**, as changing directions while firing will cause the bomb to reel back to Isaac at high speed, making self-damage very likely.
* [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") / [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") / (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spirit_Sword.png)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") / [![image](/image/Tech_X.png)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): Overrides Tractor Beam.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Euthanasia.png)](/wiki/Euthanasia "Euthanasia") [Euthanasia](/wiki/Euthanasia "Euthanasia"): Needles fired will follow beam; however, burst needles will not.
* (Removed in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Explosivo.png)](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo") [Explosivo](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo"): Explosivo's tears will become "entangled" when sticking on an enemy, causing them to jump from the tractor beam to the enemy and vice versa every frame. The tear will explode only once regardless while attached to an enemy or bound to the beam.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Eye_Sore.png)](/wiki/Eye_Sore "Eye Sore") [Eye Sore](/wiki/Eye_Sore "Eye Sore"): No effect on the extra tears.
* [![image](/image/Guillotine.png)](/wiki/Guillotine "Guillotine") [Guillotine](/wiki/Guillotine "Guillotine"): The beam will visually follow Isaac's head as it orbits, but tears will still stay centered relative to Isaac's body.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Haemolacria.png)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): Fired tears will travel along the beam; however, the burst tears will not.
* [Homing tears](/wiki/Homing_tears "Homing tears"): The tears will stay in the line but will slow down when near enemies.
* [(Hook Worm)](/wiki/Hook_Worm "Hook Worm") [Hook Worm](/wiki/Hook_Worm "Hook Worm"): Overridden, except for the Range increase.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Incubus.png)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus"): The Incubus tears aren't affected by the beam, but the beam will still be there.

* [![image](/image/Marked.png)](/wiki/Marked "Marked") [Marked](/wiki/Marked "Marked"): Tears will only fire in cardinal directions.
* [![image](/image/Multidimensional_Baby.png)](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby"): The beam only affects the original tears, not the duplicated ones.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Ouroboros Worm)](/wiki/Ouroboros_Worm "Ouroboros Worm") [Ouroboros Worm](/wiki/Ouroboros_Worm "Ouroboros Worm"): Tears will stall at points along their path; the normal spiral pattern is negated entirely, however.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Saturnus.png)](/wiki/Saturnus "Saturnus") [Saturnus](/wiki/Saturnus "Saturnus"): No effect on orbital tears.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Sprinkler.png)](/wiki/Sprinkler "Sprinkler") [Sprinkler](/wiki/Sprinkler "Sprinkler"): Tears fired by the sprinkler will follow Isaac's beam.

	+ (Added in Repentance) The beam becomes unaffected by Isaac's momentum.
* [![image](/image/Tiny_Planet.png)](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") [Tiny Planet](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet"): The orbitting effect is overridden, but Isaac still gains the Range increase and spectral tears.


Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | (Added in Repentance) Tractor Beam has unusual effects when combined with [![image](/image/Continuum.png)](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum") [Continuum](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum") and [![image](/image/Pop!.png)](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") [Pop!](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!")[[1]](#cite_note-1). While shooting, tears will appear for brief moments at the back of Isaac's head, and if he hits an enemy with one of these, that enemy will be teleported to a corner of the screen for poorly understood reasons. Isaac himself can also get teleported to a corner, resulting in a potential softlock without flight or [![image](/image/How_to_Jump.png)](/wiki/How_to_Jump "How to Jump") [How to Jump](/wiki/How_to_Jump "How to Jump"). |
