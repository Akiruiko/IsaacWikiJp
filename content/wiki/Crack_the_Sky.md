Effects[]
---------


* Spawns an [item](/wiki/Item "Item") from the current room's [item pool](/wiki/Item_pool "Item pool").
* Consumes one of Isaac's [heart containers](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health"), one [bone heart](/wiki/Health#Bone_Hearts "Health"), or two [soul hearts](/wiki/Health#Soul_Hearts "Health"), replaced by a [broken heart container](/wiki/Health#Broken_Hearts "Health") which can never be filled, permanently reducing his maximum possible health.
	+ The priority order of hearts that will be consumed is: one heart container, one bone heart, and two soul hearts.
* After using Magic Skin, if Isaac is not currently holding it, Magic Skin has a chance to replace any item that spawns in the future.
	+ The more times Magic Skin is used, the higher chance it will respawn.
	+ Each new Magic Skin is fully recharged.
* If Isaac gets 12 or more broken heart containers by using Magic Skin, this item will disappear and future items won't be replaced.


Notes[]
-------


* [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") and  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") will be able to use the item once, after which it disappears.
	+ An extra item cannot be spawned when used with [(Car Battery)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery").
* [(Tainted Jacob)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") [Tainted Jacob](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") in his Lost form will be able to use the item up to 12 times, after which it disappears. He does not gain broken hearts.
	+ Unseen health of Lost form will be filled with broken hearts, meaning [(Heartbreak)](/wiki/Heartbreak "Heartbreak") [Heartbreak](/wiki/Heartbreak "Heartbreak") may not work.
* [(? Card)](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") [? Card](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") does not count toward Magic Skin's use limit. This is especially useful when playing as any of the 3 above characters.
* [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") gain a [broken coin container](/wiki/Health#Coin_Hearts "Health"), reducing their effective health by 1.
	+ [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") can use it up to 3 times, and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") can use it up to 2 times before Magic Skin disappears. But if they have [(Deep Pockets)](/wiki/Deep_Pockets "Deep Pockets") [Deep Pockets](/wiki/Deep_Pockets "Deep Pockets") and [(Greed's Gullet)](/wiki/Greed%27s_Gullet "Greed's Gullet") [Greed's Gullet](/wiki/Greed%27s_Gullet "Greed's Gullet"), or [(Mother's Kiss)](/wiki/Mother%27s_Kiss "Mother's Kiss") [Mother's Kiss](/wiki/Mother%27s_Kiss "Mother's Kiss"), they can use it more than 2~3 times.
		- Although they can have 13 or more coin hearts in some environment, they still die when they have 12 broken coin heart containers.
* Using Magic Skin after touching the [white fire](/wiki/White_Fire_Place "White Fire Place") in [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") II/[(Dross)](/wiki/Dross "Dross") [Dross](/wiki/Dross "Dross") II will still add broken hearts for when the character is revived.
* [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") is able to find Magic Skin while  [(Dead Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus") [Dead Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus") is carrying it, and vice versa.
* If either  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") or  [(The Soul)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)") has 6 broken hearts by using Magic Skin, this item will disappear and they will instantly die.
* [(Heartbreak)](/wiki/Heartbreak "Heartbreak") [Heartbreak](/wiki/Heartbreak "Heartbreak") or [(VI - The Lovers?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "VI - The Lovers?") [VI - The Lovers?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") will add broken hearts, lessening maximum use of Magic Skin.
* Isaac dies instantly if he has 12 broken hearts.
* Dying and reviving using any item will remove one broken heart, preventing Isaac from dying immediately.
* Broken heart containers can be removed by donating to a [Confessional](/wiki/Machines#Confessional "Machines").

* [(Damocles)](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles") [Damocles](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles"): Spawns 2 items on every use instead of 1.
* [(Dream Catcher)](/wiki/Dream_Catcher "Dream Catcher") [Dream Catcher](/wiki/Dream_Catcher "Dream Catcher"): If Magic Skin has replaced the item in the [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room"), it will be shown in the dream sequence.
* [(Esau Jr.)](/wiki/Esau_Jr. "Esau Jr.") [Esau Jr.](/wiki/Esau_Jr. "Esau Jr."): Since Esau Jr.'s health is separate from Isaac's, one character can use Magic Skin at no cost to the other. Future items will still be replaced when playing as the character that hasn't used Magic Skin.
* [(Schoolbag)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"): Isaac can keep Magic Skin in the inactive slot to prevent its respawning while still being able to use another active item.
* [(Spindown Dice)](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") [Spindown Dice](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice"): Using Spindown Dice on Magic Skin 6 times turns it into [(R Key)](/wiki/R_Key "R Key") [R Key](/wiki/R_Key "R Key").

Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Genesis)](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") [Genesis](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis"): Removes all broken hearts as well as items. Magic Skin can still replace items in the Genesis room.

Reentering the room and using Magic Skin will spawn the same item.
* [(Lemegeton)](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") [Lemegeton](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton"): Magic Skin can be spawned by Lemegeton if it has been used in the current run. As long as Isaac has this flame, Magic Skin will not respawn/replace items.
* [(Metronome)](/wiki/Metronome "Metronome") [Metronome](/wiki/Metronome "Metronome"): Getting Magic Skin from Metronome has a chance to instantly apply the item replacement and spawn Magic Skin as an item pedestal.
* [(NO!)](/wiki/NO! "NO!") [NO!](/wiki/NO! "NO!"): Does not prevent Magic Skin from replacing items, despite it being an active item.
* [(TMTRAINER)](/wiki/TMTRAINER "TMTRAINER") [TMTRAINER](/wiki/TMTRAINER "TMTRAINER"): Prevents Magic Skin from replacing items, since future Magic Skins will be glitched.
* [(Void)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): Absorbing Magic Skin does not prevent future items from being replaced, including items spawned by the absorbed Magic Skin.

	+ [(Dead Cat)](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") [Dead Cat](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat"): If Isaac has 12 broken hearts and dies, he will be revived with one full heart. If the heart is a red heart container, it can be filled after taking a half heart of damage.
