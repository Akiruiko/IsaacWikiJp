Effect[]
--------


* Grants a random item's effect for the current room.


Notes[]
-------


* Beware using this as  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"), as it can trigger self-harm items and kill him.
* Using this item multiple times in the same room will replace the previous item with a new one.
* Metronome cannot grant the effects of itself, [(Glowing Hour Glass)](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass") [Glowing Hour Glass](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass"), [(Plan C)](/wiki/Plan_C "Plan C") [Plan C](/wiki/Plan_C "Plan C"), [(Clicker)](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker") [Clicker](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker"), or (Added in Repentance)[(R Key)](/wiki/R_Key "R Key") [R Key](/wiki/R_Key "R Key").
* Keep in mind that you can trigger items you haven't unlocked yet, which means you could trigger the effect of items like (Added in Repentance)[(Death Certificate)](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate") [Death Certificate](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate") without having to go through the trouble of unlocking them.
* If Metronome triggers the effect of (Added in Repentance)[(Genesis)](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") [Genesis](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis"), it will disappear from the active slot, just as with the real item.
* Metronome has a reduced chance of activating (Added in Repentance)[(Genesis)](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") [Genesis](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") or (Added in Repentance)[(Death Certificate)](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate") [Death Certificate](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate").


Synergies[]
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a wisp based on the item that Metronome chooses. For example, if Metronome chooses [(Spirit Sword)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword"), the spawned wisp is a sword that fires sword projectiles.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Blanket)](/wiki/Blanket "Blanket") [Blanket](/wiki/Blanket "Blanket") / [(Holy Card)](/wiki/Holy_Card "Holy Card") [Holy Card](/wiki/Holy_Card "Holy Card") / [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") / [(Wooden Cross)](/wiki/Wooden_Cross "Wooden Cross") [Wooden Cross](/wiki/Wooden_Cross "Wooden Cross"): if Metronome is used while the shield is active, any stat changes or familiars/orbitals generated from Metronome will persist between rooms until Metronome is used again or replaced with another active item. Items that modify your stats and have other additional effects will keep the stats but the effect will be gone after leaving the room. For example, the tears down applied from [(The Inner Eye)](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") [The Inner Eye](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") will persist between rooms, but Isaac will not shoot three tears at once.
	+ Some tear effects from items will remain active between rooms. These include:
		- [(Continuum)](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum") [Continuum](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum"), [(Epic Fetus)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"), [(Eve's Mascara)](/wiki/Eve%27s_Mascara "Eve's Mascara") [Eve's Mascara](/wiki/Eve%27s_Mascara "Eve's Mascara"), [(Godhead)](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead") [Godhead](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead"), [(Ipecac)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"), [(Jacob's Ladder)](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder") [Jacob's Ladder](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder"), [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"), [(A Lump of Coal)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal"), [(Monstro's Lung)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"), [(My Reflection)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection"), [(Ouija Board)](/wiki/Ouija_Board "Ouija Board") [Ouija Board](/wiki/Ouija_Board "Ouija Board"), [(Pop!)](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") [Pop!](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!"), [(Rubber Cement)](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement") [Rubber Cement](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement"), [(Sacred Heart)](/wiki/Sacred_Heart "Sacred Heart") [Sacred Heart](/wiki/Sacred_Heart "Sacred Heart"), [(Spoon Bender)](/wiki/Spoon_Bender "Spoon Bender") [Spoon Bender](/wiki/Spoon_Bender "Spoon Bender"), [(Strange Attractor)](/wiki/Strange_Attractor "Strange Attractor") [Strange Attractor](/wiki/Strange_Attractor "Strange Attractor"), [(Technology Zero)](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero") [Technology Zero](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero")
	+ Some items behave unusually after leaving the room while the Holy Mantle shield was active:
		- Items that grant flight: Isaac's appearance is reset back to normal, but he is still able to fly.
		- [(1up!)](/wiki/1up! "1up!") [1up!](/wiki/1up! "1up!"): the mushroom familiar continues to follow Isaac, but doesn't grant an extra life.
		- [(Cupid's Arrow)](/wiki/Cupid%27s_Arrow "Cupid's Arrow") [Cupid's Arrow](/wiki/Cupid%27s_Arrow "Cupid's Arrow"): the tear appearance is reset back to normal, but the tears still travel through enemies.
		- [(Fire Mind)](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind") [Fire Mind](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind"): the tear appearance is reset back to normal, but tears can still explode when they hit an enemy.
		- [(Mysterious Liquid)](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid") [Mysterious Liquid](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid"): the tear appearance is reset back to normal, but tears will still leave green creep on the ground.
		- [(Spear of Destiny)](/wiki/Spear_of_Destiny "Spear of Destiny") [Spear of Destiny](/wiki/Spear_of_Destiny "Spear of Destiny"): does not persist between rooms.
* [(Car Battery)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Metronome is activated twice at once as expected, but the item chosen for the first activation is shown raised above Isaac's head, instead of the second one that actually remains active.
