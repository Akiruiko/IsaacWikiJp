 # Sinus Infection ![image](/image/Sinus_Infection.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants a chance to fire a booger that sticks to an enemy and deals damage over time.
	+ Multiple boogers can stick to one enemy to deal extra damage.
	+ Each booger deals damage equal to Isaac's tear damage every second.
	+ The booger lasts for 60 seconds or until the enemy dies.
		- (Added in Repentance) The booger lasts 10 seconds.
	+ Boogers cannot pierce and stick to the first enemy that they come in contact with, but will pass through fireplaces even without piercing shots.


Notes
-------


* The booger falls off the enemy after they die. If it hits another enemy before it touches the ground, it will stick to them and deal damage.
* Jumping enemies or bosses like [Monstro](/wiki/Monstro "Monstro") and [Leapers](/wiki/Leaper "Leaper") and burrowing enemies like [Round Worms](/wiki/Round_Worm "Round Worm") and [Lumps](/wiki/Lump "Lump") can get rid of the booger when they leap or burrow.
	+ Bosses like [The Harbingers](/wiki/The_Harbingers "The Harbingers") or [Dark One](/wiki/Dark_One "Dark One"), or enemies like [Oob](/wiki/Oob "Oob") that have dash attacks do not lose the booger when they go off-screen.
* The tear-sticking effect is similar to [![image](/image/Explosivo.png)](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo") [Explosivo](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo") and (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Mucormycosis.png)](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis") [Mucormycosis](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis")'s.
* Booger shots behave like piercing shots against bombs and fireplaces, making it potentially difficult to evade hostile bombs or push bombs along.
* The [(Nose Goblin)](/wiki/Nose_Goblin "Nose Goblin") [Nose Goblin](/wiki/Nose_Goblin "Nose Goblin") trinket's effect is almost identical to Sinus Infection, with an added [homing](/wiki/Homing_tears "Homing tears") bonus.
	+ The effects have independent chances to trigger. If Isaac has both, there is a chance to fire either homing or non-homing boogers.
* Not affected by [Luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body"): Booger tears will split into split booger tears that can attach to enemies.
* [![image](/image/Godhead.png)](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead") [Godhead](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead"): Shots retain their aura while stuck to an enemy, but the aura can damage only enemies other than the booger victim. If the enemy dies while duration remains, it will resume homing and will often stick to a second enemy.
* [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy"): Every damage instance that a booger shot does while attached to an enemy will trigger a fly to spawn.
* [![image](/image/Lachryphagy.png)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): All tears have a chance to burst into boogers. Boogers will always burst into more boogers, though some of the boogers may incorrectly appear to be normal tears. When a booger sticks to an enemy, it will burst into 8 boogers which have a high chance of sticking again to the same enemy.
* [![image](/image/Lost_Contact.png)](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact") [Lost Contact](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact"): Boogers that stick to enemies will block shots, and will not be destroyed in the process.
* [![image](/image/Polyphemus.png)](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") [Polyphemus](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus"): Booger shots lose the Polyphemus pierce effect, but stick to enemies while dealing the full damage of the Polyphemus shot. Damage does not degrade.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spirit_Sword.png)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword"): Swing has chance to apply booger on enemy.
* [![image](/image/Strange_Attractor.png)](/wiki/Strange_Attractor "Strange Attractor") [Strange Attractor](/wiki/Strange_Attractor "Strange Attractor"): Attraction effect will remain on the booger shot stuck to an enemy. This can drag the enemy across the whole room until they reach one wall and get stuck on it, effectively disabling their normal movement.
