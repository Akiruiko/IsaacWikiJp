 # Shade ![image](/image/Shade.png) 


Effects
---------


* Grants a shadow [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that follows Isaac's movements on a 1-second delay and deals 2 contact damage per tick or 30 damage per second to enemies.
* Shade is absorbed by Isaac after dealing 600 damage.
	+ The familiar disappears and turns into friendly dark [Chargers](/wiki/Charger "Charger"), similar to those spawned by [![image](/image/My_Shadow.png)](/wiki/My_Shadow "My Shadow") [My Shadow](/wiki/My_Shadow "My Shadow").
	+ Isaac will now do equal contact damage at the same rate as the Shade used to.
		- [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") will continue to work on Isaac even after absorption, doubling damage dealt.
		- Isaac's contact damage increases when absorbing multiple Shade familiars.


Notes
-------


* If other familiars that move with a similar pattern such as [![image](/image/Multidimensional_Baby.png)](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") have been collected before the Shade, it will follow them instead with further delay.
* If Isaac gains a method of flight, Shade will gain wings.
* Cannot be removed with [![image](/image/Sacrificial_Altar.png)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar") [Sacrificial Altar](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar")
