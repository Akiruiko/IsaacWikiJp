Effects[]

* Shade is absorbed by Isaac after dealing 600 damage.
	+ The familiar disappears and turns into friendly dark [Chargers](/wiki/Charger "Charger"), similar to those spawned by [(My Shadow)](/wiki/My_Shadow "My Shadow") [My Shadow](/wiki/My_Shadow "My Shadow").
	+ Isaac will now do equal contact damage at the same rate as the Shade used to.
		- [(BFFS!)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") will continue to work on Isaac even after absorption, doubling damage dealt.

-------


* If other familiars that move with a similar pattern such as [(Multidimensional Baby)](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") have been collected before the Shade, it will follow them instead with further delay.
* If Isaac gains a method of flight, Shade will gain wings.
