Notes
-------


* Sleeping on a [bed](/wiki/Bed "Bed") will give ??? three Soul Hearts.
* Enemies who deal full hearts of damage can be very dangerous in the early floors of the game.
* [![image](/image/The_Poop.png)](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop") [The Poop](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop") - While not the most useful item, it can allow ??? to cross small gaps by bombing the Poop from the opposite side, much like one would for Rocks. Furthermore, in rooms with non-flying enemies that chase the player (except Spiders), the poop can be used in a corner of the room making ??? untouchable, allowing the player to kill them without taking damage (if the player moves away from the pile of Poop generated, this will no longer work).
	+ Other utilities to the poop includes generating pickup, repelling projectiles once per room and destroying retracted spikes, benefitting ???'s defensive playstyles.
* [Bone Hearts](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart") grant an empty Bone Heart upon pickup, but they cannot be refilled using Red Hearts.


Item Interactions
-------------------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright"): [Soul hearts](/wiki/Hearts "Hearts") gained from health ups will be doubled.


### Positive


* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Abaddon.png)](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") [Abaddon](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") costs three Soul Hearts and grants six Black Hearts, damage up, fear shot, and no negative effects to ???. Abaddon can be bought safely regardless of current health, because its price can be deducted from the acquired Black Hearts retroactively.
	+ (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Abaddon.png)](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") [Abaddon](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") will give 2 black hearts on pickup, granting its effects essentially for one heart.
* [![image](/image/Ankh.png)](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") [Ankh](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") is effectively a [![image](/image/1up!.png)](/wiki/1up! "1up!") [1up!](/wiki/1up! "1up!") for ???.
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Athame.png)](/wiki/Athame "Athame") [Athame](/wiki/Athame "Athame") can be used to produce black hearts upon taking damage.
* [Balls of Steel](/wiki/Balls_of_Steel "Balls of Steel") pills or [(V - The Hierophant)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "V - The Hierophant") [V - The Hierophant](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") grant two soul hearts, both of which are more useful than normal HP up items.
* The [(Rune of Dagaz)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Dagaz") [Rune of Dagaz](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") grants one soul heart as well as lifting any curses.
* (Removed in Afterbirth) The [(XI - Strength)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XI - Strength") [XI - Strength](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") card gives ??? a permanent soul heart.
* [![image](/image/Book_of_Revelations.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Revelations "Book of Revelations") [Book of Revelations](/wiki/Book_of_Revelations "Book of Revelations") Spawns soul hearts.
* [![image](/image/Ceremonial_Robes.png)](/wiki/Ceremonial_Robes "Ceremonial Robes") [Ceremonial Robes](/wiki/Ceremonial_Robes "Ceremonial Robes") costs three Soul Hearts and grants three Black Hearts and damage up. (Removed in Repentance) Like [![image](/image/Abaddon.png)](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") [Abaddon](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon"), this item is always safe to take.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Crown_of_Light.png)](/wiki/Crown_of_Light "Crown of Light") [Crown of Light](/wiki/Crown_of_Light "Crown of Light") will always activate when entering a room, but still deactivates after taking damage.
* [![image](/image/Mitre.png)](/wiki/Mitre "Mitre") [Mitre](/wiki/Mitre "Mitre") and [(Daemon's Tail)](/wiki/Daemon%27s_Tail "Daemon's Tail") [Daemon's Tail](/wiki/Daemon%27s_Tail "Daemon's Tail") replace useless Red Hearts with Soul and Black Hearts respectively.
* [![image](/image/Dark_Bum.png)](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum") [Dark Bum](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum") converts useless Red Hearts into Black Hearts and Spiders.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Dark Bum can now also drop pills, cards, and runes, which can include [(V - The Hierophant)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "V - The Hierophant") [V - The Hierophant](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), [Balls of Steel](/wiki/Pills "Pills"), or [(Rune of Dagaz)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Dagaz") [Rune of Dagaz](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes").
* [![image](/image/Dead_Cat.png)](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") [Dead Cat](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") will set Soul Hearts to 1, but can be used to gain devil deals by sacrificing the extra lives.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Dim Bulb)](/wiki/Dim_Bulb "Dim Bulb") [Dim Bulb](/wiki/Dim_Bulb "Dim Bulb") is able to be activated every room due to the single charge on [![image](/image/The_Poop.png)](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop") [The Poop](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop"), providing a consistent stat boost.
* [![image](/image/Gimpy.png)](/wiki/Gimpy "Gimpy") [Gimpy](/wiki/Gimpy "Gimpy") has a chance to spawn Soul Hearts when hit.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Hallowed_Ground.png)](/wiki/Hallowed_Ground "Hallowed Ground") [Hallowed Ground](/wiki/Hallowed_Ground "Hallowed Ground") turns all [![image](/image/The_Poop.png)](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop") [The Poop](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop") uses into holy poops.
* [![image](/image/Lazarus%27_Rags.png)](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags") [Lazarus' Rags](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags") causes ??? to be resurrected as  [(Lazarus Risen)](/wiki/Lazarus_Risen "Lazarus Risen") [Lazarus Risen](/wiki/Lazarus_Risen "Lazarus Risen") when he dies, allowing the gathering of heart containers. Once this happens, however, you are no longer playing as ???, and therefore cannot get any of his achievements/unlocks. The same effect happens with the use of [![image](/image/Judas%27_Shadow.png)](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow") [Judas' Shadow](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow").
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Maw_of_the_Void.png)](/wiki/Maw_of_the_Void "Maw of the Void") [Maw of the Void](/wiki/Maw_of_the_Void "Maw of the Void") can produce Black Hearts.
* [![image](/image/Midas%27_Touch.png)](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") [Midas' Touch](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") makes [![image](/image/The_Poop.png)](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop") [The Poop](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop") create [Golden Poop](/wiki/Golden_Poop "Golden Poop").
* [(Monkey Paw)](/wiki/Monkey_Paw "Monkey Paw") [Monkey Paw](/wiki/Monkey_Paw "Monkey Paw") will drop 3 [Black Hearts](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart"), but must take damage for each one to spawn.
* [(Petrified Poop)](/wiki/Petrified_Poop "Petrified Poop") [Petrified Poop](/wiki/Petrified_Poop "Petrified Poop") is useful early on to get more pickups from [![image](/image/The_Poop.png)](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop") [The Poop](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop") every room.
* [![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") and [![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") will always activate when taking damage.
* [![image](/image/The_Relic.png)](/wiki/The_Relic "The Relic") [The Relic](/wiki/The_Relic "The Relic"), which is generally useful, is especially useful to ??? as it spawns Soul Hearts.
* [![image](/image/Satanic_Bible.png)](/wiki/Satanic_Bible "Satanic Bible") [Satanic Bible](/wiki/Satanic_Bible "Satanic Bible") generates Black Hearts.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Using Satanic Bible now also causes boss items to turn into devil deals that cost hearts, so it may be best to hold off on using it until after the boss fight.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Serpent%27s_Kiss.png)](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") [Serpent's Kiss](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") can produce Black Hearts by poisoning enemies.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Serpent's Kiss now only produces Black Hearts from contact damage poison, making it slightly less useful for ???.
* [![image](/image/Squeezy.png)](/wiki/Squeezy "Squeezy") [Squeezy](/wiki/Squeezy "Squeezy") and (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Mr._Dolly.png)](/wiki/Mr._Dolly "Mr. Dolly") [Mr. Dolly](/wiki/Mr._Dolly "Mr. Dolly") increase ???'s tears and can grant Soul Hearts.
* [![image](/image/Whore_of_Babylon.png)](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") [Whore of Babylon](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") is always active.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") will double the effectiveness of HP upgrades, meaning ??? gains twice as many soul hearts as normal.
	+ This can be exploited with [![image](/image/Converter.png)](/wiki/Converter "Converter") [Converter](/wiki/Converter "Converter") to generate unlimited HP.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Fortune_Cookie.png)](/wiki/Fortune_Cookie "Fortune Cookie") [Fortune Cookie](/wiki/Fortune_Cookie "Fortune Cookie") can give a soul heart upon use.


### Negative


* Items that directly add Red Hearts to the health bar, such as [![image](/image/Yum_Heart.png)](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart") [Yum Heart](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart"), (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Yuck_Heart.png)](/wiki/Yuck_Heart "Yuck Heart") [Yuck Heart](/wiki/Yuck_Heart "Yuck Heart") or full health [pills](/wiki/Pill "Pill"), are useless. However eternal hearts still act as an extra half a heart and become a full soul heart at the end of the floor making [![image](/image/Prayer_Card.png)](/wiki/Prayer_Card "Prayer Card") [Prayer Card](/wiki/Prayer_Card "Prayer Card") viable.
* [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine") and [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_Beggar "Devil Beggar") are riskier, as they deplete health that is harder to replenish.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Cursed Skull)](/wiki/Cursed_Skull "Cursed Skull") [Cursed Skull](/wiki/Cursed_Skull "Cursed Skull") will automatically teleport ??? out of the room upon taking any damage, as he doesn't have any Red Hearts. This can be used to easily warp out of the [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") room, but is mostly an annoyance.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Works only at half a soul heart.
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Glass_Cannon.png)](/wiki/Glass_Cannon "Glass Cannon") [Glass Cannon](/wiki/Glass_Cannon "Glass Cannon") will bring ??? down to half a Soul Heart, and not give back any health upon leaving a room due to ???'s lack of Red Hearts. This item essentially takes away most of the player's health in exchange for a single high damage tear.
	+ (Added in Repentance) This effect no longer applies in Repentance, making it a more viable choice. Even so, caution should be used, as taking damage will cause all subsequent damage taken in the room to be two full soul hearts, making this especially risky for ???.
* [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Paw.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") [Guppy's Paw](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw"), since requiring Red Hearts to convert, would be a useless item to hold (but should still be picked up and swapped back to get credit towards the [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy") transformation). Guppy's Paw may still be used to activate [(Broken Remote)](/wiki/Broken_Remote "Broken Remote") [Broken Remote](/wiki/Broken_Remote "Broken Remote").
* [(Judas' Tongue)](/wiki/Judas%27_Tongue "Judas' Tongue") [Judas' Tongue](/wiki/Judas%27_Tongue "Judas' Tongue") doesn't lower the price of Soul Heart Devil deals.
* [![image](/image/Little_C.H.A.D..png)](/wiki/Little_C.H.A.D. "Little C.H.A.D.") [Little C.H.A.D.](/wiki/Little_C.H.A.D. "Little C.H.A.D.") is useless unless paired with [![image](/image/Dark_Bum.png)](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum") [Dark Bum](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum") or (Added in Repentance)[(Apple of Sodom)](/wiki/Apple_of_Sodom "Apple of Sodom") [Apple of Sodom](/wiki/Apple_of_Sodom "Apple of Sodom"), where it becomes very useful.
