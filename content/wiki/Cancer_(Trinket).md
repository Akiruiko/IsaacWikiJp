 # Cancer ![image](/image/Cancer_(Trinket).png) 

Effect
--------


* (Removed in Repentance) -2 [tear delay](/wiki/Tear_delay "Tear delay") (increased rate of fire)
	+ Since this directly affects tear delay instead of changing the tears stat, it allows Isaac's rate of fire to go over the normal maximum rate.
	+ Tear delay decreases are more noticeable and are a greater increase to DPS when the tears stat is high.


* (Added in Repentance) +1.0 [fire rate](/wiki/Fire_rate "Fire rate").


Notes
-------


* Cancer's tear delay reduction scales with the current tear modifier's fire rate multiplier, the only exception being [(Chocolate Milk)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk").
