 # Shard of Glass ![image](/image/Shard_of_Glass.png) 

Effects
---------


* Adds a 25% chance to drop a [full Red Heart](/wiki/Hearts#Red_Heart "Hearts") upon taking damage.
* (Removed in Repentance) Adds a separate 10% chance to gain the [![image](/image/Anemic.png)](/wiki/Anemic "Anemic") [Anemic](/wiki/Anemic "Anemic") effect (+5 [range](/wiki/Range "Range"), red creep trail) for the current room upon taking damage.
* (Added in Repentance) Taking damage will cause Isaac to bleed, spewing red tears around him constantly.
	+ Holding a direction of fire focuses the bleeding tears to that direction, with slightly increased range.
		- The direction of bleeding can be aimed diagonally, even when Isaac does not possess [![image](/image/Analog_Stick.png)](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick") [Analog Stick](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick").
	+ After bleeding for 20 seconds, Isaac's Red Hearts or Rotten Hearts will take damage (bypassing other Hearts); this is indicated by Isaac slowly turning red after and eventually blinking. This damage also has a 25% chance to drop a full Red Heart. The damaging effect will continue to occur every 20 seconds until the bleeding effect ends.
		- The damage amount is always half a [Red Heart](/wiki/Health#Red_Hearts "Health"), a [Coin Heart](/wiki/Health#Coin_Hearts "Health"), or a [Rotten Heart](/wiki/Health#Rotten_Hearts "Health"), even in later [chapters](/wiki/Chapters "Chapters") where most damage is now a full Heart or two Rotten Hearts.
	+ The bleeding effect ends when Isaac receives any form of Red Heart or Rotten Heart healing, if he has no more Red or Rotten Hearts, or if the next hit would kill him.
	+ If Isaac has no Red or Rotten Hearts, the bleeding effect of Shard of Glass will not activate.
	+ The bleeding effect carries over to the next floor if Isaac moves on to the next floor while still bleeding.


Notes
-------


* Red Hearts spawned by this item may become different hearts in certain [Super Secret Rooms](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room").
* Playing as  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") or  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") will cause the hearts spawned to turn to Blue Flies immediately.
* (Added in Repentance) If Shard of Glass is rerolled while Isaac is bleeding, the bleeding will continue, but Red Hearts will no longer spawn when Isaac takes damage. This makes Shard of Glass especially deadly to  [(Tainted Eden)](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden") [Tainted Eden](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden").
* (Added in Repentance)  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") can end the bleeding by switching to  [![image](/image/The_Soul.png)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)").
* (Added in Repentance) The bleeding effect works with  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"). They will bleed and lose a coin heart until only one coin is left. Receiving coins will stop the bleeding effect. Due to Tainted Keeper only having two coin hearts in most circumstances, bleeding will rarely apply to him.
* (Added in Repentance) Rotten Hearts will take bleeding damage only when Isaac has no red hearts remaining. Picking up Rotten Hearts will also end the bleeding.
* (Added in Repentance) Using a [bed](/wiki/Bed "Bed") to heal Isaac's red hearts will not stop the bleeding.
* (Added in Repentance)Turning into The Lost via the [White Fire Place](/wiki/White_Fire_Place "White Fire Place") or [Soul of the Lost](/wiki/Soul_of_the_Lost "Soul of the Lost") will stop bleeding effect.
