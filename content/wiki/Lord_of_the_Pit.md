 # Lord of the Pit ![image](/image/Lord_of_the_Pit.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants [Flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight").
* +0.3 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") ((Removed in Afterbirth) not applied until the next time Isaac's speed stat is updated).


Notes
-------


* [![image](/image/Spirit_of_the_Night.png)](/wiki/Spirit_of_the_Night "Spirit of the Night") [Spirit of the Night](/wiki/Spirit_of_the_Night "Spirit of the Night") costs the same amount of Red Hearts as Lord of the Pit, while granting [spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears") instead of increased speed. ItÂ´s strongly recommended to take Spirit of the Night if the player has the choice.
