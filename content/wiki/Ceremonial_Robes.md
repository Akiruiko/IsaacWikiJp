Notes[]
-------


* Mama Mega! opens the paths to (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") and the [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)") even after the time limits expire.
	+ The Boss does not need to be defeated before entering these doors.
	+ It will also open the Boss Rush / [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)") entrance room door if it is activated after [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom") or [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart")/[It Lives!](/wiki/It_Lives! "It Lives!") has already been defeated.
	+ Leaving the (Boss Room) [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_Room "Boss Room") (via teleport or entering a (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room")/(Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room")) will close the doors.
	+ Leaving the (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") room or [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)") entrance room will also close the doors.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Does not open a path to [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)") if used in the room on the other side of the flesh door in [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") / [(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") II.
* Entering a room with an angel statue while the effect is active automatically initiates a fight with an [Angel](/wiki/Angel "Angel").
* Does not kill Lil' Haunts and other enemies that are immune to damage while entering the room.
* If used before the [Ultra Greed](/wiki/Ultra_Greed "Ultra Greed") fight begins, it will deal no damage to Ultra Greed, as he is invulnerable for the first few seconds upon first entering his room. However, it will still break obstacles as usual.
* When used in [Greed mode](/wiki/Greed_mode "Greed mode"), it will only activate once for the main room (as opposed to once per wave, in a similar fashion to a standard run). Therefore, its damage potential is maximized if used after all the monster waves have spawned for the current floor.
* Does not open the door to [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") in [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") or [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)").
* (Added in Repentance) If used in [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") / [(Dross)](/wiki/Dross "Dross") [Dross](/wiki/Dross "Dross") II, the entrance to the [Mirrored World](/wiki/Mirrored_World "Mirrored World") will be destroyed, making it inaccessible.
	+ If used in the [Mirrored World](/wiki/Mirrored_World "Mirrored World"), it will destroy the exit, which, on top of making it impossible to leave, will then cause Isaac to take damage and die.
	+ This can be avoided by entering and immediately leaving the room before the shockwave reaches the mirror.
* (Added in Repentance) Does not open the flesh door at the end of [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") / [(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") II.
