Effects[]
---------


* Enemies that touch Isaac are transformed into [poop](/wiki/Poops "Poops").

Notes[]
-------


* Bosses cannot be turned into poop.
* Poop created by this item is not grid-aligned, and flashes red when hit, similar to damaging [monsters](/wiki/Monster "Monster").
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) Poops produced by E. Coli crumble upon being attacked, identically to regular poops.
* If you touch the middle section of a [Grub](/wiki/Grub "Grub") with E. Coli, it will then split and become two heads (rather than destroying and spawning [Maggots](/wiki/Maggot "Maggot")).
* [Mullibooms](/wiki/Mulliboom "Mulliboom") can be turned into poop without taking damage.
* The poops vanish if the room is left and then returned to.
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) Poops created by E. Coli do not heal Isaac when he has the [Oh Crap](/wiki/Oh_Crap "Oh Crap") transformation.
* (Added in Repentance) Poops created by E. Coli heal Isaac when he has the [Oh Crap](/wiki/Oh_Crap "Oh Crap") transformation.
