 # GB Bug ![image](/image/GB_Bug.png) 

Effects
---------


* (Removed in Repentance) Spawns a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that bounces diagonally around the [room](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms"), deals 8 damage per tick or 120 damage per second and applies a random [status effect](/wiki/Status_Effects "Status Effects") to enemies it comes in contact with. The familiar also has a chance to re-roll [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") that it passes over into other pickups, [chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests"), or [items](/wiki/Items "Items"), in an uncleared room only (with at least one enemy alive).
* (Added in Repentance) Spawns a familiar that follows Isaac. Double tapping the fire button launches it forward, causing it to reroll the first [monster](/wiki/Monster "Monster"), [trinket](/wiki/Trinkets "Trinkets"), or [pickup](/wiki/Pickup "Pickup") it hits. It respawns after clearing a room.
	+ If it cannot reroll an enemy (e.g. a boss), it will deal 8 damage instead.
	+ Items and opened chests cannot be rerolled.
	+ Pickups have a 10% chance of becoming chests (see [the algorithm](#Algorithm)).
		- If a chest is rerolled, it has a 28% chance of staying as some kind of a chest.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) GB Bug can block projectiles.
* (Removed in Repentance) GB Bug does more damage per second than [![image](/image/The_Peeper.png)](/wiki/The_Peeper "The Peeper") [The Peeper](/wiki/The_Peeper "The Peeper"), with the added random status chance.
* (Added in Repentance) GB Bug is able to reroll (Added in Repentance) [(Throwable Bomb)](/wiki/Throwable_Bomb "Throwable Bomb") [Throwable Bombs](/wiki/Throwable_Bomb "Throwable Bomb") into normal consumables. After doing so, the corresponding (Added in Repentance) [(Bomb Grimace)](/wiki/Stone_Grimace#Bomb_Grimace "Bomb Grimace") [Bomb Grimace](/wiki/Stone_Grimace#Bomb_Grimace "Stone Grimace") will generate another Throwable Bomb, making it able to generate a potentially large amount of free consumables.
* (Added in Repentance) Rerolled [champion](/wiki/Champion "Champion") enemies will retain their color, unless they reroll into a monster that cannot naturally spawn as a champion.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[(The Twins)](/wiki/The_Twins "The Twins") [The Twins](/wiki/The_Twins "The Twins"): The familiar can be duplicated even if it hasnâ€™t respawned; by constantly moving to new rooms, GB Bug can constantly respawn, allowing pickups to be rerolled indefinitely.
