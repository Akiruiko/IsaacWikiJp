 # Spirit Sword ![image](/image/Spirit_Sword.png) 


Effects
---------


* Copies the effect of Isaac's held [card](/wiki/Card "Card") (Removed in Repentance) or [rune](/wiki/Rune "Rune").
	+ (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) Also mimics [(Dice Shard)](/wiki/Dice_Shard "Dice Shard") [Dice Shard](/wiki/Dice_Shard "Dice Shard") and [(Emergency Contact)](/wiki/Emergency_Contact "Emergency Contact") [Emergency Contact](/wiki/Emergency_Contact "Emergency Contact").


Notes
-------


* Using the Blank Card does not expend the consumable.
* [Pills](/wiki/Pill "Pill") can be mimicked only by (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Placebo.png)](/wiki/Placebo "Placebo") [Placebo](/wiki/Placebo "Placebo").
* (Added in Repentance) Runes and soul stones can be mimicked only by [![image](/image/Clear_Rune.png)](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune") [Clear Rune](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune").
* Using the Blank Card with a consumable that is not compatible, or no consumable at all, will spend the charge with no effect.

**Single use:**
* [(? Card)](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") [? Card](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card")
	+ ? Card has a unique interaction with Blank Card, noted in the synergies section.







Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Butter!)](/wiki/Butter! "Butter!") [Butter!](/wiki/Butter! "Butter!"): Because Blank Card is dropped upon usage, the recharge time for it is reset to 4, allowing to use more expensive cards much more frequently.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns wisps in the center ring, looking like cards. The wisps spawn [Cards](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Cards "Cards and Runes") when destroyed, and enemies killed by the wisps' tears have a 15% chance to drop a Card. The effect of the wisps and the types of cards they spawn are independent from Blank Card's charge time and the most recently used card.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery")/(Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Tarot_Cloth.png)](/wiki/Tarot_Cloth "Tarot Cloth") [Tarot Cloth](/wiki/Tarot_Cloth "Tarot Cloth"): Essentially uses the card twice. If used with the Two of Hearts/Diamonds/etc. cards it will quadruple whatever amount Isaac has.
	+ **Car Battery** + **Tarot Cloth**: The card is used 4 times at once.
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) [(2 of Diamonds)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "2 of Diamonds") [2 of Diamonds](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") + [![image](/image/Restock.png)](/wiki/Restock "Restock") [Restock](/wiki/Restock "Restock") or in [Greed mode](/wiki/Greed_mode "Greed mode"): [Coins](/wiki/Coins "Coins") can be infinitely generated by buying [Lil' Batteries](/wiki/Lil%27_Battery "Lil' Battery"). As Lil' Batteries only cost 5 coins, as long as Isaac starts with at least 11, the maximum of 99 coins can be quickly reached.
	+ (Added in Repentance) This cannot be repeated infinitely, as **Restock** now increases the price of a shop slot every time something is purchased from it. Having 12 coins will very slowly allow Isaac to obtain 99 coins, however.
		- This does not apply in greed mode.
		- Having [![image](/image/Deep_Pockets.png)](/wiki/Deep_Pockets "Deep Pockets") [Deep Pockets](/wiki/Deep_Pockets "Deep Pockets") allows this to once again be repeated infinitely, as the price will cap at 999 coins.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(? Card)](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") [? Card](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card"): Teleports Isaac to the (I AM ERROR) [I AM ERROR](/wiki/I_AM_ERROR "I AM ERROR") room. This will consume both the Blank Card and the ? Card.
	+ An exception is when they are used on [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)"), [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room"), or [Ultra Greed](/wiki/Ultra_Greed "Ultra Greed") floors. Using them here consumes both the Blank Card and the ? Card and spawns an I AM ERROR [Shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper").
		- (Added in Repentance) Likewise occurs on [(Home)](/wiki/Home "Home") [Home](/wiki/Home "Home") floors.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Rune of Jera)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Jera") [Rune of Jera](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Allows Isaac to copy pickups with every use. This combination can double [Lil' Batteries](/wiki/Lil%27_Battery "Lil' Battery"), which can allow for game-breaking combos, due to repeated use of the synergy.
	+ Spawning too many items will cause objects to despawn. This can even despawn the [End](/wiki/Endings "Endings") Chest after finishing a final boss fight.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Little_Baggy.png)](/wiki/Little_Baggy "Little Baggy") [Little Baggy](/wiki/Little_Baggy "Little Baggy"): All cards are replaced by pills, rendering Blank Card useless, unless Isaac also has [![image](/image/Starter_Deck.png)](/wiki/Starter_Deck "Starter Deck") [Starter Deck](/wiki/Starter_Deck "Starter Deck").
* (Added in Repentance)[(Wild Card)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Wild Card") [Wild Card](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Does nothing if used through Blank Card. Wild Card can, however, copy the last card that was used through Blank Card.
