	+ (Removed in Repentance) The knife deals 15 damage every 1/15th of a second (every 4 frames) or 225 damage per second.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The knife deals 15 damage every 2/15ths of a second (every 8 frames) or 112.5 damage per second.


Notes
-------


* Sacrificial Dagger deals the highest amount of contact damage out of all orbitals.
* The dagger orbits further away from Isaac than many other orbital familiars (minus [![image](/image/Big_Fan.png)](/wiki/Big_Fan "Big Fan") [Big Fan](/wiki/Big_Fan "Big Fan")), making it easier to use both offensively and defensively.
