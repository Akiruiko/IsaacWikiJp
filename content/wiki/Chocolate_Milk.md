 # Chocolate Milk ![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png) 


Effects
---------


* Grants charged tears that deal greater damage when fully charged.
	+ Tear damage scales from approximately 10% damage at a minimum charge to 400% damage at full charge.
	+ The numbers above occur with very high tear delay. A high tears stat can increase the minimum damage dealt, but decreases the maximum damage dealt.
	+ (Added in Repentance) At 30.00 fire rate or above (0 tear delay or lower), charging is no longer needed. Higher fire rate results in higher tear damage. At 120.00 fire rate, tears deal 4x Isaac's damage.
* (Removed in Repentance) Tears down: Delay * 2.5.


Notes
-------


* Repeatedly pressing a key to fire allows Isaac to fire as quickly as the key is pressed, up to the equivalent of a maxed tears stat. This is not generally recommended, as overall damage per second is greatly reduced.
	+ Rapid-fire can useful to deal with low-health enemies, for whom DPS is less relevant.

* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Compound_Fracture.png)](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") [Compound Fracture](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture")/[![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body")/[![image](/image/The_Parasite.png)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Split tears do half the damage of normal tears.
* [![image](/image/Godhead.png)](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead") [Godhead](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead"): Charging the shots increase the size and damage of the aura.
* [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy"): Firing quickly generates lots of Blue Flies, which each deal 200% of your tear damage.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Haemolacria.png)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): Increased tear delay. Completely charged shots and their burst tears are larger and deal higher damage than normal. Chocolate Milk also allows low-damage Haemolacria shots to be fired rapidly.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Isaac%27s_Tears.png)](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Tears "Isaac's Tears") [Isaac's Tears](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Tears "Isaac's Tears")/[![image](/image/Sad_Bombs.png)](/wiki/Sad_Bombs "Sad Bombs") [Sad Bombs](/wiki/Sad_Bombs "Sad Bombs")/[![image](/image/Tammy%27s_Head.png)](/wiki/Tammy%27s_Head "Tammy's Head") [Tammy's Head](/wiki/Tammy%27s_Head "Tammy's Head"): The size and damage of all generated tears correspond to the current charge level of Chocolate Milk. Isaac's Tears will nearly instantly recharge while charging a Chocolate Milk shot.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Charge level does not effect generated tears. Isaac's Tears recharge only when a shot is fired.
* [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Increased tear delay. Charged shots deal massively increased damage, as the +40 damage from Ipecac is run through the damage multiplier of Chocolate Milk. It also allows low-damage Ipecac shots to be fired rapidly.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Lachryphagy.png)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Rapidly firing small, uncharged tears can cause the fed tear to grow into a gigantic tear that will still deal fairly low damage while feeding tears with charged tears will result in higher-damage tears.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Mom%27s_Wig.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Wig "Mom's Wig") [Mom's Wig](/wiki/Mom%27s_Wig "Mom's Wig"): Spiders rapidly spawn while charging.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Spiders spawn only when a shot is fired.
* [![image](/image/Monstro%27s_Lung.png)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"): (Removed in Repentance) Reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20%, allowing Monstro's Lung to charge faster. Each tear from Monstro's Lung is also a charged Chocolate Milk shot, massively increasing damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Tear delay is increased, and the tear damage, along with the amount of tears fired is dependent on charge time.
* [![image](/image/Polyphemus.png)](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") [Polyphemus](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus"): Increased tear delay. Massively increases the damage of each shot, and charged tears decay in damage much slower as a result.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Sinus_Infection.png)](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") [Sinus Infection](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection"): Booger damage is influenced by the damage of the individual tear, so fully-charged Chocolate Milk shots can result in very potent damage over time.
* [![image](/image/Technology_2.png)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2"): Damage dealt by the laser is equal to Isaac's current charge, leading to constant high damage from a safe distance.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The laser deals 20% of Isaac's damage regardless of charge, tears are affected by Chocolate Milk as normal.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Trisagion.png)](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion") [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion"): Fully charged beams deal four times normal damage. Trisagion's shots are colored brown.
* [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): When charging the club, instead of being thrown, the club grows bigger, doing more damage.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Anti-Gravity.png)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): No effect, but retains the reduced tear delay.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Doesn't increase damage, but reduces Isaac's current [tear delay](/wiki/Tears#Tear_Delay "Tears") by 20% (allows Brimstone to charge faster). Beam is colored brown. It also applies to [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel")'s default mini-brimstone.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Brimstone laser takes longer to fully charge, but can be released at any point during its charge. Width and damage of the laser increases at higher charges. Width scales from 50% at minimum charge to 160% at maximum charge. Damage scales from 25% at minimum charge to 250% at maximum charge. Unlike with normal tears, the tears stat does not directly affect maximum or minimum damage.
		- [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel"): If the charge is released quickly (before the charge meter is about 33% full) Tainted Azazel will sneeze. If released after that, he will shoot a laser instead.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Cursed_Eye.png)](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") [Cursed Eye](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye"): The charge bar only indicates the current charge for Chocolate Milk, not for Cursed Eye; the latter's charge is determined by the eye's glow. If charged until Cursed Eye fully glows, Isaac fires one Chocolate Milk shot, followed by up to three minimal power ones.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Cursed Eye takes longer to charge, but low damage shots can be fired rapidly. If fully charged, Isaac fires five Chocolate Milk shots.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Bombs can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Dr. Fetus to fire faster). Bombs are brown.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Missiles can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Epic Fetus' missiles to be fired with a shorter delay between them). Changes the explosion color to brown.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): The tear can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows The Ludovico Technique to deal damage faster). Turns the tear into a Chocolate Milk tear.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Doesn't increase damage, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Mom's Knife to charge faster). The knife turns brown.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Marked.png)](/wiki/Marked "Marked") [Marked](/wiki/Marked "Marked"): Isaac will automatically charge his shots. Fire rate increases when the crosshair is closer to Isaac, and damage increases when the crosshair is farther from Isaac.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Mega_Blast.png)](/wiki/Mega_Blast "Mega Blast") [Mega Blast](/wiki/Mega_Blast "Mega Blast"): Firing the Mega Blast beam while Chocolate Milk charges preserve the charge, but does not increase the beam's damage.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Neptunus.png)](/wiki/Neptunus "Neptunus") [Neptunus](/wiki/Neptunus "Neptunus"): Overrides Chocolate Milk's active charge. Tear damage is determined by how charged Neptunus is.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): Overrides Chocolate Milk, but Isaac gains a flat +1 damage bonus after the Soy Milk damage penalty.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Shoots moderately charged shots at a quick pace with no increase in damage.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"): Lasers can't be charged, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Technology to fire faster). Lasers are colored brown.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Lasers can be charged, dealing up to 4x damage when fully charged. Low-damage lasers can also be fired rapidly. Tear delay isn't decreased.
		- At 30.00 fire rate or above (0 tear delay or lower), charging is no longer needed. When fire rate is between 30.00 and 50.00, laser deals 4x damage; higher fire rate causes laser to deal 0.1x damage instead (possibly a bug).
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Tech_X.png)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): Doesn't increase damage, but reduces Isaac's current tear delay by 20% (allows Tech X to charge faster). Laser rings are colored brown.
