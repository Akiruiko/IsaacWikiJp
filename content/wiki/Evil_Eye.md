 # Evil Eye ![image](/image/Evil_Eye.png) 

Effect
--------


* Isaac will occasionally fire a slow-moving eye with an infinite range that fires tears identical to Isaac's tears in the direction that Isaac is firing.
	+ The chance is affected very slightly by [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck") and never gets very high.


Notes
-------


* The eye has the same rate of fire and damage as Isaac.
* The direction of the eye's tears is affected by the direction the eye is traveling in.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Now fire in the same direction as Isaac.
* If the eyes are spawned from The Forgottens Melee attack, the eyes will pick up items off the floor in the same way The Forgottens melee attack does.
* The eyes are not treated as familiars and therefore will not synergize with items like [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!").
* Eyes disappear when hitting walls, enemies, and obstacles, even if Isaac has piercing or spectral tears.
	+ Familiars like [![image](/image/Dry_Baby.png)](/wiki/Dry_Baby "Dry Baby") [Dry Baby](/wiki/Dry_Baby "Dry Baby"), (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Angry_Fly.png)](/wiki/Angry_Fly "Angry Fly") [Angry Fly](/wiki/Angry_Fly "Angry Fly") and even (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Finger!.png)](/wiki/Finger! "Finger!") [Finger!](/wiki/Finger! "Finger!") also destroy the eye on collision.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Astral_Projection.png)](/wiki/Astral_Projection "Astral Projection") [Astral Projection](/wiki/Astral_Projection "Astral Projection"): During the time-stop period of Astral Projection, there is a chance that the eyes fired will stop in the air instead of flying in a direction, and will last indefinitely until an enemy bump into it, greatly increase the existing time of evil eyes. Triggering of Astral Projection also greatly increase fire rate, giving a higher possibility to fire eyes.


* [Homing tears](/wiki/Homing_tears "Homing tears"): Eyes will fire homing tears; however, the eye itself will not home in on enemies.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Pop!.png)](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") [Pop!](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!"): Eyes will fire eyeball tears but cannot be knocked around by them.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spirit_Sword.png)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword"): Massively powerful, will "swing" in the direction isaac is is firing for as long as it is held and has slightly less range than Isaac's base stat.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Trisagion.png)](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion") [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion"): Eyes will fire beams. Occasionally causes Trisagion beams to stay static in the air for a few seconds, dealing damage to enemies that come in contact with them.
* Items that reduce shot speed, such as [![image](/image/Dead_Onion.png)](/wiki/Dead_Onion "Dead Onion") [Dead Onion](/wiki/Dead_Onion "Dead Onion"), can be beneficial, as eyes will stay on the screen longer.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Eye.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye") [Mom's Eye](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye"): Evil eye has a chance to be shot backwards, but will still fire in the direction Isaac is shooting
