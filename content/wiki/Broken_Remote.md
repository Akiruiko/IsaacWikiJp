Notes
-------


* Upon using [(The Bible)](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") [The Bible](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") while fighting [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom"), Isaac will get teleported out of the room before the death animation is finished, resulting in the boss room being reset.
* This item can only teleport Isaac to rooms that can be shown on the map. It is not possible to teleport to the [I AM ERROR](/wiki/I_AM_ERROR "I AM ERROR") room, [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room"), [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room"), [Crawl Space](/wiki/Crawl_Space "Crawl Space"), [Black Market](/wiki/Black_Market "Black Market"), [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush"), the room with the access to [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)"), or [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan").
* During [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") fight, Broken Remote will teleport you randomly on the screen.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Spin to Win)](/wiki/Spin_to_Win "Spin to Win") [Spin to Win](/wiki/Spin_to_Win "Spin to Win") does not work at all with Broken Remote.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Mine Crafter)](/wiki/Mine_Crafter "Mine Crafter") [Mine Crafter](/wiki/Mine_Crafter "Mine Crafter") does not work with Broken Remote if there is already a TNT barrel in the room.
* For some reason, (Added in Repentance)[(Mom's Bracelet)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Bracelet "Mom's Bracelet") [Mom's Bracelet](/wiki/Mom%27s_Bracelet "Mom's Bracelet") produces a faster teleport with Broken Remote than with any other item.
