 # Gello ![image](/image/Gello.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns a demon [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that's attached to Isaac, moving in the direction Isaac shoots, and automatically shooting (whenever Isaac is shooting) in the direction of the closest enemy to him using Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage"), [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears"), [range](/wiki/Range "Range"), [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed"), and [special](/wiki/Status_Effects "Status Effects") [tear effects](/wiki/Tear_effects "Tear effects").
	+ If Isaac has any tear modifier that requires him to charge his shots (like [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone")), Gello will automatically "release" the fire bottom for himself every time he is fully charged. If Isaac releases the charge bottom himself, Gello will do that too, regardless of his current charge of an attack.
	+ Gello's tears deal 0.75x Isaac's damage, or 1.0x if used by  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith").


Notes
-------


* [(Tainted Lilith)](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith") [Tainted Lilith](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith") attacks in the way identical to this item.
* The familiar persists when  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") switches states.
* If used multiple times in the same room, the Gellos will eventually overlap perfectly and appear as one after some movement, but all remain functional. This makes Gello exceptionally powerful in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode"), [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush"), and against [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a red wisp on the middle ring. The wisps will orbit Gello instead of Isaac while it's active.
* [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel"): Each time Gello starts charging an attack, he will "sneeze" just like Tainted Azazel does, cursing enemies in front of him. This allows Tainted Azazel to keep enemies cursed without needing to come in dangerously close distance to them.
