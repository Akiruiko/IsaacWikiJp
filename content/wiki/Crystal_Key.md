 # Crystal Key ![image](/image/Crystal_Key.png) 

Effects
---------


* Whenever Isaac clears a room, has a chance to open a neighboring (Red Room) [Red Room](/wiki/Red_Room "Red Room").
	+ This effect can occur while Isaac is inside a Red Room, but the chance is smaller.


Notes
-------


* It's possible to increase the chance of a (Red Room) [Red Room](/wiki/Red_Room "Red Room") unlocking if multiple Crystal Keys are held, e.g. from absorbing using [(Smelter)](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter"), holding [(Mom's Box)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box") [Mom's Box](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box"), having a [golden](/wiki/Golden_Trinket "Golden Trinket") Crystal Key, or other methods. The chance for a Red Room door to unlock depends on the number of Crystal Keys held and if the room cleared is normal or Red.
