	+ (Added in Repentance) The fly follows Isaac on a 0.66 second delay instead.

Notes
-------


* If other familiars that move with a similar pattern such as [![image](/image/Multidimensional_Baby.png)](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") have been collected before the Obsessed Fan, it will follow them instead with further delay.
