Effects
---------


* When used, swaps between the current character and Esau Jr., who has three [black hearts](/wiki/Hearts "Hearts"), +2 flat [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage"), and [flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight").
	+ Despite starting with only black hearts, Esau Jr. is able to gain heart containers.
* [Coins](/wiki/Coins "Coins"), [bombs](/wiki/Bombs "Bombs"), and [keys](/wiki/Keys "Keys") are shared between the two characters, but everything else (including hearts, [items](/wiki/Items "Items"), [cards](/wiki/Cards "Cards")/[pills](/wiki/Pills "Pills"), and [trinkets](/wiki/Trinkets "Trinkets")) are not shared and apply only to the character that collects them.
	+ Esau Jr. will have the same base stats, character-specific abilities and passive starting items (such as  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith")'s blindfold and [![image](/image/Incubus.png)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus")) as the original character.
		- The only exception is  [(Eden)](/wiki/Eden "Eden") [Eden](/wiki/Eden "Eden")/ [(Tainted Eden)](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden") [Tainted Eden](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden"), who will have different stats and passive starting items.
* When used for the first time, Esau Jr. immediately gains random items equal to the number of items the original character had.
	+ Each new item will come from the same item pool the respective original item was taken from, similarly to the [![image](/image/D4.png)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4").
	+ Substitute [Trinkets](/wiki/Trinkets "Trinkets"), [Cards](/wiki/Cards "Cards"), [Pills](/wiki/Pills "Pills"), and/or [Active items](/wiki/Items "Items") are not given; only passive items are.
	+ Quest items like [![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") and set drops like [![image](/image/The_Small_Rock.png)](/wiki/The_Small_Rock "The Small Rock") [The Small Rock](/wiki/The_Small_Rock "The Small Rock") are not included when counting the number of items.
	+ Any pickups that would normally be generated by the new items will all simultaneously drop when Esau Jr. is first used.
* If either character dies, they both die, regardless of whether the other character has any remaining health.


Notes
-------


* The item may have severely glitchy interactions with some characters. Refer to the [bugs](#Bugs) section.
* Esau Jr. will keep any passive starting items the original character had; however, if said item(s) are rerollable, they will still count towards the number of items Esau Jr. will get.
	+ For example, if  [(Eve)](/wiki/Eve "Eve") [Eve](/wiki/Eve "Eve") uses Esau Jr for the first time, Esau Jr. will get both [![image](/image/Dead_Bird.png)](/wiki/Dead_Bird "Dead Bird") [Dead Bird](/wiki/Dead_Bird "Dead Bird") and [![image](/image/Whore_of_Babylon.png)](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") [Whore of Babylon](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") as well as two extra [Treasure Room items](/wiki/Treasure_Room_(Item_Pool) "Treasure Room (Item Pool)") in addition to the ones he would normally receive.
	+ Active items in the original character's consumable slot will also be given to Esau Jr in his consumable slot (such as  [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene")'s [![image](/image/Yum_Heart.png)](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart") [Yum Heart](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart") or  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas")' [![image](/image/Dark_Arts.png)](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts") [Dark Arts](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts")).
* If the original character was only able to use certain kinds of hearts for health (such as  [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)"),  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper"), or  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten")), Esau Jr. will only be able to use the hearts the original character could.
* Unlike revival items like [![image](/image/Lazarus%27_Rags.png)](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags") [Lazarus' Rags](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags"), [![image](/image/Judas%27_Shadow.png)](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow") [Judas' Shadow](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow"), [(Missing Poster)](/wiki/Missing_Poster "Missing Poster") [Missing Poster](/wiki/Missing_Poster "Missing Poster"), or [![image](/image/Ankh.png)](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") [Ankh](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh"), Esau Jr. is still treated as the character he swapped from for the purposes of Post It Notes.
* If an inactive character has an [eternal heart](/wiki/Hearts "Hearts") when the active character goes to a new floor, the eternal heart will turn into a heart container when that character becomes active again.
* If the original character doesn't fly and you swap to it on some part of the room just reachable by flying (i.e. beyond some water), you won't be able to leave (unless you can swap back to Esau Jr. or teleport by any means), effectively going into a softlock. This situation can be worked around by exiting and continuing the game, as the character appears next to a door.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") /  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") /  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"): Esau Jr. will have one heart container, but can still gain heart containers up to the character's normal cap.
	+ In the case of Bethany, Soul Hearts will still be used as soul charges instead of health.
* [![image](/image/Blood_Oath.png)](/wiki/Blood_Oath "Blood Oath") [Blood Oath](/wiki/Blood_Oath "Blood Oath") / [![image](/image/Card_Reading.png)](/wiki/Card_Reading "Card Reading") [Card Reading](/wiki/Card_Reading "Card Reading") / [![image](/image/Dream_Catcher.png)](/wiki/Dream_Catcher "Dream Catcher") [Dream Catcher](/wiki/Dream_Catcher "Dream Catcher") / [![image](/image/Isaac%27s_Tomb.png)](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Tomb "Isaac's Tomb") [Isaac's Tomb](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Tomb "Isaac's Tomb") / [![image](/image/Luna.png)](/wiki/Luna "Luna") [Luna](/wiki/Luna "Luna") / [![image](/image/Voodoo_Head.png)](/wiki/Voodoo_Head "Voodoo Head") [Voodoo Head](/wiki/Voodoo_Head "Voodoo Head"): The character that has the item must be active going to a new floor for it to have its effect.
	+ In the case of Luna, the character that has the item must also be active going into Secret Rooms for them to spawn beams of light. However, either character can then enter the beam of light to gain tears and soul hearts.
* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a black wisp when used to turn into Esau Jr. that is otherwise identical to a normal one; turning back into the original character destroys the wisp. All other wisps are retained between forms.
* [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Esau Jr. will only activate once, allowing it to be used normally.
* [![image](/image/Chaos.png)](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos") [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos") / [![image](/image/Sacred_Orb.png)](/wiki/Sacred_Orb "Sacred Orb") [Sacred Orb](/wiki/Sacred_Orb "Sacred Orb") / [![image](/image/TMTRAINER.png)](/wiki/TMTRAINER "TMTRAINER") [TMTRAINER](/wiki/TMTRAINER "TMTRAINER"): Will affect the items given to Esau Jr. when used for the first time, but will not affect subsequent uses. Item generation is only affected if the character that has it is currently active.
* [![image](/image/Eden%27s_Blessing.png)](/wiki/Eden%27s_Blessing "Eden's Blessing") [Eden's Blessing](/wiki/Eden%27s_Blessing "Eden's Blessing"): The extra item given from turning into Esau Jr. for the first time will be different from the one given by Eden's Blessing.
* [![image](/image/Empty_Heart.png)](/wiki/Empty_Heart "Empty Heart") [Empty Heart](/wiki/Empty_Heart "Empty Heart") / [![image](/image/Missing_No..png)](/wiki/Missing_No. "Missing No.") [Missing No.](/wiki/Missing_No. "Missing No."): If the character that has the item is inactive going to a new floor, it will activate for them immediately when they become active.
* [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): If used as The Forgotten, Esau Jr. will have three empty bone hearts and the bone club, and cannot gain soul hearts. Both forms will also be unable to turn into The Soul. If used as  [![image](/image/The_Soul.png)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)"), Esau Jr. will not be bound to The Forgotten's Body. If used again to turn back into The Soul, The Forgotten's Body will also be summoned alongside them, but the player cannot turn back into them, preventing them from moving between rooms and causing a softlock.
* [![image](/image/Genesis.png)](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") [Genesis](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis"): Using Genesis as Esau Jr. will revert back to the original character.
* [![image](/image/Lemegeton.png)](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") [Lemegeton](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton"): Wisps will be retained between forms. For the character that doesn't have Lemegeton, the wisps effects are only updated when one of them is destroyed.
* [![image](/image/Lost_Soul.png)](/wiki/Lost_Soul "Lost Soul") [Lost Soul](/wiki/Lost_Soul "Lost Soul"): The soul respawns every time the character that has Lost Soul becomes active. If it's the first time Lost Soul spawned after going to a new floor, it will give a reward, regardless of whether or not it died on the previous floor.
* [(Panic Button)](/wiki/Panic_Button "Panic Button") [Panic Button](/wiki/Panic_Button "Panic Button"): Activates Esau Jr. before the active character takes damage, redirecting the damage to the inactive character. The item's charge is used in the process.
* [![image](/image/Schoolbag.png)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"): The extra active item will continue to be held by the character that has Schoolbag. However, it cannot gain charges through any means until the character becomes active again.
* [(Tainted Cain)](/wiki/Tainted_Cain "Tainted Cain") [Tainted Cain](/wiki/Tainted_Cain "Tainted Cain"): The items given to Esau Jr. on the first use are based on the item pool of the first room Tainted Cain gained an item from. Other abilities are unchanged.
* [(Tainted Eden)](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden") [Tainted Eden](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden"): Taking damage will turn Esau Jr. back into Tainted Eden, along with all of its other effects. Tainted Eden's health before transforming into Esau Jr. will not be recovered.
* [(Tainted Jacob)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") [Tainted Jacob](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob"): Esau Jr. takes half a heart of contact damage from [Dark Esau](/wiki/Dark_Esau "Dark Esau") instead of turning into a ghost. Dark Esau's death explosion also does not affect him.
* [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene"): Esau Jr.'s starting black hearts will quickly drain down to half a heart; he must obtain heart containers while in this form to have any survivability.
