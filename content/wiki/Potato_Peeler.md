Notes
-------


* It is possible for Isaac to kill himself by removing his final heart container.
* It is possible to generate multiple Meat Boys.
* Cubes of Meat given by this item do not remove any Cubes of Meat from [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode") item pools.
* (Added in Repentance) The Cube of Meat gained through this item will persist in the escape sequence of [(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines") II.
* This item cannot normally be used on Soul Hearts, Black Hearts, Bone Hearts, or Eternal Hearts.
	+ (Added in Repentance) If used with  [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany")'s [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") and Bone Hearts, it can be used infinitely. This will only produce [wisps](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues#Combinations "Book of Virtues"), not cubes of meat.

Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns an indestructible wisp. The wisps do not orbit Isaac, block shots, or deal contact damage. Instead, they chase and constantly shoot at nearby enemies.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/D4.png)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4"): Every Cube of Meat produced using Potato Peeler counts as an item for rerolling. Because health usually is not removed when rerolling items, this is useful to increase the number of items at the expense of the item pool.
	+ Cubes of Meat created by Potato Peeler will always reroll into [Treasure Room items](/wiki/Treasure_Room_(Item_Pool) "Treasure Room (Item Pool)"), regardless of where Potato Peeler was obtained or the rooms it was used in.
* (Added in Repentance)[(III - The Empress?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "III - The Empress?") [III - The Empress?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes")/[(XI - Strength)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XI - Strength") [XI - Strength](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): The temporary hearts granted by the cards can be used to create a Cube of Meat.
