Effects[]
---------


* While holding Flip, when Isaac enters a new room containing an item ((Treasure Room) [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room"), (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop"), etc.), the item pedestal will have a second "ghostly" item behind it.
	+ The real item can be interacted with normally, while the ghostly item cannot.
	+ The ghostly item will vanish if there is no real item on the pedestal and Isaac leaves the room.
* Upon use, flips all real / ghostly items around on pedestals, allowing Isaac to collect the ghostly items. Does not affect pedestals that do not contain a ghostly item.
	+ If playing as  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus"), activating it also flips between them and  [(Dead Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus") [Dead Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus").


Notes[]
-------


* When used on someone other than Tainted Lazarus, it only flips items and cannot flip them between forms, including [(Esau Jr.)](/wiki/Esau_Jr. "Esau Jr.") [Esau Jr.](/wiki/Esau_Jr. "Esau Jr.")
* Flip has no effect on item pedestals that do not generate upon the creation of the room (i.e. Boss items, items from chests / beggars, etc.).
* Buying a real item, such as from a [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop") or [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room"), will also buy the ghostly version for free, although it can still only be obtained using Flip.


Synergies[]

* [(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a small white Isaac head wisp. If you are playing Tainted Lazarus the wisp is given to the form that isn't holding Book of Virtues. A wisp is also granted when flip is automatically used by clearing the room as Tainted Lazarus.
* [(The D6)](/wiki/The_D6 "The D6") [The D6](/wiki/The_D6 "The D6") / [(Rune of Perthro)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Perthro") [Rune of Perthro](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") / [(Dice Shard)](/wiki/Dice_Shard "Dice Shard") [Dice Shard](/wiki/Dice_Shard "Dice Shard"), etc.: Only rerolls visible item. Ghostly items remain unchanged.
* [(Tainted Isaac)](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") / [(Glitched Crown)](/wiki/Glitched_Crown "Glitched Crown") [Glitched Crown](/wiki/Glitched_Crown "Glitched Crown"): Does not affect the secondary item, even if it's currently visible. Alternation effect only applies to the primary item while visible.
