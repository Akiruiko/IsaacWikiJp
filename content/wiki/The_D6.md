 # The D6 ![image](/image/The_D6.png) 


Effect
--------


* Hurts Isaac without taking away health, activating any items that trigger upon taking damage.


Notes
-------


* As using the Dull Razor will grant invincibility frames like normal damage, this item can be used to enter (Curse Room) [Curse Rooms](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") for free, or, with proper timing, allow Isaac to avoid taking damage from an enemy or obstacle.
* (Removed in Repentance) The invincibility frames allow Isaac to use [(Blood Donation Machine.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/6/6e/Blood_Donation_Machine.png/revision/latest?cb=20210821075842) [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Machines#Blood_Donation_Machine "Machines") and [(Devil Beggar.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/b/b6/Devil_Beggar.png/revision/latest?cb=20210821101216) [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Beggar#Devil_Beggar "Beggar") for free.
* (Added in Repentance) Dull Razor ignores shields granted by [![image](/image/Holy_Mantle.png)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle"), and similar items.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a grey wisp on the middle ring. The wisp doesn't fire any tears. Whenever Isaac takes damage, there is a chance that the damage is negated and one of the wisps is destroyed instead. "Damage" taken from using Dull Razor does not count for this effect.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") Dull Razor activates twice, triggering on-damage items twice.


Interactions
--------------


For a full list of items that work with Dull Razor, see the list of [damage triggered items](/wiki/Category:Damage-triggered_items "Category:Damage-triggered items"). Note that any specific extra conditions the items may have for their activation still apply.

* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Dull Razor activates twice, but "damage" is only dealt once, not triggering synergies a second time.
