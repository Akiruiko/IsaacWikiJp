 # Anemic ![image](/image/Anemic.png) 


Effects
---------


* When used, the next shot will fire a large, [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone")-like laser in the direction Isaac shoots that deals double Isaac's tear damage. If Isaac is already shooting, the item immediately activates in that direction.
	+ The laser hits up to 13 times.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth â€ ) [Status effects](/wiki/Status_effect "Status effect") can be applied by the laser.


Notes
-------


* Despite the laser looking very similar to Brimstone, it doesn't share most of the Brimstone-specific interactions.
* This item can drop from [Envy](/wiki/Envy "Envy").
* Can still be used while [blindfolded](/wiki/Blindfolded "Blindfolded").
* This item synergizes extremely well with items that significantly increase damage such as [![image](/image/Polyphemus.png)](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") [Polyphemus](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") and [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac").


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/4.5_Volt.png)](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") [4.5 Volt](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt"): Allows the item to be charged and used multiple times in a room, which can help with dealing extra damage in enduring fights like most endgame bosses.
* [![image](/image/9_Volt.png)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt"): Can be used once every room, and more frequently in [Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room").
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns white wisps in the outer ring. The wisps also fire lasers when Isaac uses Shoop Da Whoop!. The lasers deal 7 damage per tick (BUG: 3.5 if Isaac has [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!")), and can hit up to 10 times for a total of 70 damage. Multiple lasers can hit the same enemy.
* [(Broken Remote)](/wiki/Broken_Remote "Broken Remote") [Broken Remote](/wiki/Broken_Remote "Broken Remote"): Since item charges aren't expended until Isaac chooses a direction to shoot, the player can teleport across the floor indefinitely.
