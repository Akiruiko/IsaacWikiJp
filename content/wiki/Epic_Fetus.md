Notes[]
-------


* Bad pills already obtained/dropped will be converted to their "good" counterparts.
* If PHD is lost in any way, such as rerolling by the [(D4)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4") or a [Dice Room](/wiki/Dice_Room "Dice Room"), or dropping it as (Added in Repentance) [(Tainted Isaac)](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac"), pills will remain fully identified, but negative pills will not be converted.
* (Added in Afterbirth †) Performing a [RERUN](/wiki/RERUN "RERUN") with a character that held PHD will still prevent negative pills from spawning, but will no longer identify pills until used.
* As bad pills will turn into good pills, it is possible for two different colored pills to have the same effect.


Interactions[]
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[(False PHD)](/wiki/False_PHD "False PHD") [False PHD](/wiki/False_PHD "False PHD"): Pills can both be good or bad again. Taking a bad pill still applies the benefits from False PHD.
