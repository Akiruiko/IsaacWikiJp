 # Epic Fetus ![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png) 

Effects
---------


* Isaac's tears are replaced with guided missiles. Pressing the fire buttons spawns a crosshair that can be moved freely, summoning a missile to its position from above 1.5 seconds later.
	+ Missiles deal 20 times Isaac's damage.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Epic Fetus is a [special item](/wiki/Special_item "Special item").
* (Removed in Repentance) Epic Fetus overrides most items in the game and has the highest priority of all tear modifiers, over [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") and [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife").
* Isaac's tear delay determines how quickly a new (set of) missile(s) can be fired after the previous one has landed. Barring very high tear delay, this has little effect on damage rate due to the delay of the missiles themselves.
* Missiles benefit from some bomb modifier items, though at a lesser scale compared to [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus").
* Stacking multiple copies of the item causes a barrage of missiles in quick succession without resetting the crosshair's position, up to sixteen at a time.
* Epic Fetus missiles usually deal a full heart of damage to Isaac.
	+ Self-damage is only half a heart if the missile would deal less than 85 damage. In practice this is not common, as even a small damage stat increase will cause the missiles to go over the critical damage level.

* [![image](/image/Polyphemus.png)](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") [Polyphemus](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus"): Increased tear delay, but massively increases the missiles' blast radius and damage, as Polyphemus' damage multiplier is run through the damage multiplier of Epic Fetus.
* [![image](/image/Sad_Bombs.png)](/wiki/Sad_Bombs "Sad Bombs") [Sad Bombs](/wiki/Sad_Bombs "Sad Bombs"): Missile explosions fire ten tears in all directions. The shrapnel's damage is not run through the damage multiplier of Epic Fetus.
