 # Extension Cord ![image](/image/Extension_Cord.png) 

Effects
---------


* Bolts of electricity arc between Isaac and his [familiars](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar"), damaging any enemies between them.
	+ The bolts do 6 points of damage per strike.


Notes
-------


* [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") acts as a familiar while controlling  [(The Soul)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)"), causing electricity to arc between them. (Added in Repentance) The same applies for  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") and  [(Tainted Soul)](/wiki/Tainted_Soul "Tainted Soul") [Tainted Soul](/wiki/Tainted_Soul "Tainted Soul").
* Does not affect [temporary familiars](/wiki/Familiar#Temporary_Familiars "Familiar").
* The bolts will damage destructible [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles"), such as [(TNT)](/wiki/TNT "TNT") [TNT](/wiki/TNT "TNT") and [(Fire Place)](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place") [Fire Places](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place"), as a normal tear would.
* (Added in Repentance) If taken as  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"), electricity will arc to familiars held by both characters, not just the familiars owned by the character holding it. It will also arc between Jacob and Esau, even if neither have any familiars.
* (Added in Repentance) In [co-op](/wiki/Co-op "Co-op") mode, electricity will arc to all of them, similar to Jacob and Esau. Their familiars will also be connected.
