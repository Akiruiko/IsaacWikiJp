Effects
---------


* If Isaac has less than one full [Red Heart](/wiki/Red_Heart "Red Heart") after taking damage, he will be immediately teleported to a random room.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth â€ ) The teleportation happens only at half a heart or less left, regardless of health type. Empty [Bone Hearts](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart") are not counted as health even if they can absorb a hit.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Scapular)](/wiki/Scapular "Scapular") [Scapular](/wiki/Scapular "Scapular"): Provided Scapular can always trigger, grants effective immortality, as the soul heart is always given before the teleport takes place.
	+ +[(The Wafer)](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer") [The Wafer](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer"): Grants true immortality, plus one hit on the soul heart, allowing the player to get hit once before teleporting.


Notes
-------


* Does not affect  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"), as being hit with [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") does not count as taking damage.
	+ It will effect Isaac with [Spirit Shackles](/wiki/Spirit_Shackles "Spirit Shackles"), teleporting the player out of the room and restoring the Holy Mantle charge.
* It is not recommended to have this item equipped during a boss fight as the boss's health will be restored to 100% if the player is teleported out of the room and returns, placing the player at a disadvantage unless they have acquired a [(Placenta)](/wiki/Placenta "Placenta") [Placenta](/wiki/Placenta "Placenta").
