 # Ventricle Razor ![image](/image/Ventricle_Razor.png) 


Effects
---------


* When used for the first time, Isaac creates a blue portal under where he is standing. The next time he uses the item, he creates an orange portal under his feet. Isaac can then walk over either of the portals to teleport instantly to the location of the other one.
* Activating the item more than twice will replace the older of the two portals.
* The portals can be placed in any room. However, if a portal leads to a room with a negative grid index (i.e. [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room"), [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room"), [I AM ERROR](/wiki/I_AM_ERROR "I AM ERROR") room, [Crawl Space](/wiki/Crawl_Space "Crawl Space"), [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush"), [Black Market](/wiki/Black_Market "Black Market"), [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") room, or [Blue Womb](/wiki/Blue_Womb "Blue Womb") portal room), Isaac will not be able to enter the portal.


Notes
-------


* This item can be used to escape [Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room") or the [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush").
* (Removed in Repentance) Upon teleportation, Isaac is granted with a short invulnerability period which can be abused to trigger [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine") and [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_Beggar "Devil Beggar") without losing health by placing a portal just next to it, teleporting, and touching the Donation Machine or Beggar in the same move. This trick is particularly useful for  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"). The teleportation trick can also be used to escape [Curse Rooms](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") without taking damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) This no longer works because [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine") and [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_Beggar "Devil Beggar") take hearts without accounting for invincibility frames, however, [Curse Rooms](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") can still be entered/exited for free.
* Portals will stay even if the item is dropped or changed.
* The item can prove useful in close quarters combat, allowing the player to attack one side, then dodge attacks and jump to the other side of the room to attack the enemies on that side.
* Upon entering a new floor, the previously placed portals will disappear.
* If [Curse of the Maze](/wiki/Curse_of_the_Maze "Curse of the Maze") is active, using portals placed between different rooms may result in a random destination. Two portals in the same room work reliably.
	+ If room contents are randomized by the curse, it's possible for the portals to end up completely surrounded or even inside rocks or pits. If Isaac can't move to safety, the run can be quit and resumed to be placed at a door.
* (Added in Repentance) On [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") II, Ventricle Razor cannot be used to teleport between the normal and mirror world.
* (Added in Repentance) This item can be useful to exit Mom's boss room to start the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent"), as long as you use it at least once before entering the boss room.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): A blue/orange wisp circles the respective portal on use. One wisp orbits each portal; no wisps are given to Isaac. Wisps do not fire tears.
	+ [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Renders the item useless, as both portals are placed at the same time where the item is activated.


Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | If the animation of entering a portal created by Ventricle Razor is forcibly cancelled, then the player will be unable to fire tears and collide with any non-grid entities (including trapdoors). This essentially renders the player immune to enemy attacks, hence enabling exploits using alternate offense methods (e.g. orbitals). Exiting and continuing the run restores the collision circle and the ability to fire tears.
* Possible methods to cancel the animation are:
	+ Leaving the room as another player entity while playing as  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"),  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") or true co-op;
	+ Leaving the (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Death_Certificate.png)](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate") [Death Certificate](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate") area;
	+ Triggering the room-clear flip effect as  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus");
	+ Entering a [Crawl Space](/wiki/Crawl_Space "Crawl Space") spawned directly on top of a Ventricle Razor portal;
	+ Triggering teleportation from sources like [(Cursed Skull)](/wiki/Cursed_Skull "Cursed Skull") [Cursed Skull](/wiki/Cursed_Skull "Cursed Skull") and [![image](/image/Cursed_Eye.png)](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") [Cursed Eye](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") with timed damage mechanisms like (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[![image](/image/Shard_of_Glass.png)](/wiki/Shard_of_Glass "Shard of Glass") [Shard of Glass](/wiki/Shard_of_Glass "Shard of Glass").
