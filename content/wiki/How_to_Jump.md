Effects[]
---------


* Upon use, Isaac jumps in the direction he is currently moving. The distance of the jump depends on how fast Isaac was moving and for how long he was holding the button when the item was activated. Jumping allows Isaac to travel over [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles") such as rocks and pits.
* While mid-jump, [enemies](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters"), projectiles, [bombs](/wiki/Bombs "Bombs"), and [spikes](/wiki/Spikes "Spikes") cannot damage Isaac. Isaac cannot interact with [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") or [chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests") mid-jump.
	+ If Isaac has a Stompy trait (from items such as [(Leo)](/wiki/Leo "Leo") [Leo](/wiki/Leo "Leo") and [(Thunder Thighs)](/wiki/Thunder_Thighs "Thunder Thighs") [Thunder Thighs](/wiki/Thunder_Thighs "Thunder Thighs")), rocks won't be destroyed mid-jump
* (Added in Afterbirth †) This item belongs to the [Bookworm](/wiki/Bookworm "Bookworm") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Bookworm.


Notes[]
-------


* How to Jump can be used to easily dodge fast moving projectiles, as jumping in any direction should mean that the projectile is gone before you land.
	+ Standing still while jumping only grants invincibility for the first jump. Isaac has to move to regain invincibility while jumping
* If Isaac has [flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight"), Isaac dashes instead of jumping. This is functionally the same as jumping, but without the animation playing. Isaac will have invincibility during the dash, and the dash will only stop on terrain that can be walked on.
	+ While flying above a pit, the dash distance will be very short.
* This item can also be used to pass through otherwise impassible (Crawl Space) [Crawl Space](/wiki/Crawl_Space "Crawl Space") walls.
* Isaac can't jump through doors, which means damage from (Curse Room) [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") doors cannot be avoided.
* If this item is activated by (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Void)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"), it is possible to get stuck in an impassable area with no ability to escape. Exiting and resuming the run will place Isaac at whichever door he entered the room through.
* (Added in Repentance) How to Jump can be used to jump over pillars and spiked rocks safely.
