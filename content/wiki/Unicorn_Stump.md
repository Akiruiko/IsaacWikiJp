 # Unicorn Stump ![image](/image/Unicorn_Stump.png) 

Effects
---------


* Gives [invulnerability](/wiki/Invulnerability "Invulnerability") and +0.28 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") for six seconds, but removes the ability to shoot tears while the effect is active.


Notes
-------


* The invulnerability effect negates all forms of damage, including health loss from [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine") and [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_Beggar "Devil Beggar").
* Does not prevent [Red Heart container](/wiki/Red_Heart_container "Red Heart container") loss from [Health Down](/wiki/Health_Down "Health Down") pills or [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") deals.
* The item is similar to [![image](/image/My_Little_Unicorn.png)](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn") [My Little Unicorn](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn"), with faster recharge time at the cost of being unable to damage enemies while under its effects.
* If another spacebar item is picked up while in the [invulnerability](/wiki/Invulnerability "Invulnerability") state granted by Unicorn Stump, Isaac will return to normal immediately, becoming able to shoot tears and take damage.

* Any touch-based attacks or status effects such as [![image](/image/Aries.png)](/wiki/Aries "Aries") [Aries](/wiki/Aries "Aries") or [![image](/image/The_Virus.png)](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus") [The Virus](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus"): Freely usable in every room.
* Any orbital-like item ([![image](/image/Cube_of_Meat.png)](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") [Cube of Meat](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat"), [![image](/image/Sacrificial_Dagger.png)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Dagger "Sacrificial Dagger") [Sacrificial Dagger](/wiki/Sacrificial_Dagger "Sacrificial Dagger")): The orbital can be used freely in every single room, making it a great alternative source of damage.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns an orbital rainbow Wisp on each use of Unicorn Stump, giving up to 8 extra orbitals. Wisps do not deal contact damage.
	+ When Isaac is invulnerable, wisps become much more vibrant and deal contact damage equal to 2x Isaac's damage -5.
	+ If Isaac has less than 2.5 damage, the wisps will deal no damage even if Unicorn Stump is active.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") does contact damage in the same direction it was being held at the time of using the Unicorn Stump, giving a massive amount of free damage by ramming into an enemy.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): The tear stays in place while Isaac is invincible; although Isaac cannot move the tear, it will continue to damage enemies during his invincibility. This is very useful for stationary enemies.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Marked.png)](/wiki/Marked "Marked") [Marked](/wiki/Marked "Marked"): Isaac's tears will still fire, but he will be unable to move the crosshair while invincible.
