Effects
---------


* Allows Isaac to hold two active items.
	+ Swap between active items by pressing the PC Control key, PS4 R2, XboxOne RT, or Switch ZR.


Notes
-------


* The button to swap between active items is the same button used to swap between cards and pills.
* Items in the secondary slot will recharge at the same rate as the primary item.
* Items that grant temporary effects for the room, such as [![image](/image/The_Nail.png)](/wiki/The_Nail "The Nail") [The Nail](/wiki/The_Nail "The Nail"), may deactivate if switched with an item in the secondary slot.
* The [(? Card)](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") [? Card](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") does not activate both active items.
* While holding an active item that grants passive bonuses in the secondary slot, swapping the main slot item with a pedestal item may remove the bonuses. If this happens, Isaac can swap the bonus-granting item to the pedestal and pick it up again to regain them.
* The swap key must be pressed twice if playing as  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten").
* This item cannot be unlocked if the player encounters more than one [(Curse of the Labyrinth.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/7/77/Curse_of_the_Labyrinth.png/revision/latest?cb=20211023085047) [Curse of the Labyrinth](/wiki/Curses "Curses") in Chapters 1-3, except by chance of finding [(Silver Dollar)](/wiki/Silver_Dollar "Silver Dollar") [Silver Dollar](/wiki/Silver_Dollar "Silver Dollar"), [![image](/image/Forget_Me_Now.png)](/wiki/Forget_Me_Now "Forget Me Now") [Forget Me Now](/wiki/Forget_Me_Now "Forget Me Now"), or a 5-pip (Dice Room) [Dice Room](/wiki/Dice_Room "Dice Room").
	+ If *one* Curse of the Labyrinth is encountered, getting to [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)") and entering the (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop") there will unlock the Schoolbag.
* (Added in Repentance) If  [(Tainted Isaac)](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") drops Schoolbag, the 2nd active item in the player's inventory is destroyed. However, a duplicate active item spawns beside Schoolbag. Tainted Isaac's reroll ability applies to this new item, and the player can choose between the original active item or a new item. Picking up the original active item again will count as another item towards any transformation.
* (Added in Repentance) In "True" [Co-op](/wiki/Co-op "Co-op"), when a player dies with this item, they will drop one of their active items if they have two. It is unknown if this is a bug or intended interaction.


Synergies

* (Added in Repentance) [![image](/image/Converter.png)](/wiki/Converter "Converter") [Converter](/wiki/Converter "Converter") + [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Paw.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") [Guppy's Paw](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw")Â : Converter turns one soul heart into 1 red heart, while Guppy's paw turns 1 red heart into 3 soul hearts. This effectively gives you infinite health for the run.
* [![image](/image/Kamikaze!.png)](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!") [Kamikaze!](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!"): The cooldown before the player can use Kamikaze! again is eliminated when switching items. Depending on how fast the player can push the buttons, Kamikaze! can be used multiple times during Isaac's invincibility frames.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Box.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box") [Mom's Box](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box"): If a trinket is picked up while Mom's Box is in the active slot, swapping between active items will not remove the doubled trinket effect.
* [![image](/image/A_Pony.png)](/wiki/A_Pony "A Pony") [A Pony](/wiki/A_Pony "A Pony") / [![image](/image/White_Pony.png)](/wiki/White_Pony "White Pony") [White Pony](/wiki/White_Pony "White Pony"): Will continue to grant [flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight") and the speed bonus while held in the secondary slot
