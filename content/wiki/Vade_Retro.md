Effects[]
---------


* Continuously shooting for 2.35 seconds allows Isaac to fire a short-ranged brown [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") laser and corn shots behind himself by releasing the fire button.
	+ The laser deals Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") per tick (15x Isaac's damage per second), ticks up to 19 times and lasts ~1.28 seconds (77 frames).
	+ Corn shots deal 6 damage, and a random amount are created each blast.
* This item belongs to the [Oh Crap](/wiki/Oh_Crap "Oh Crap") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a walking pile of poop.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Brain Worm)](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm") [Brain Worm](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm"): Can cause the poop laser to hook to a target anywhere in the room, potentially hitting a target far outside of its usual range.
* [(Dark Arts)](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts") [Dark Arts](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts"): The corn Isaac poops out can be sliced, giving Isaac an insane damage up in seconds.
* [(Ipecac)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): The poop beam will unleash a barrage of explosions at the end of it.
* [(Lachryphagy)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Spawns a large amount of tears at the end of the poop beam, heavily increasing Isaac's damage output.
* [(My Reflection)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection"): Causes the beam range behind Isaac to become significantly increased as well as having a short range similar to Azazel's beam in front of him. This greatly eases the use of this item allowing for high DPS.
* [(The Parasite)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Beam splits into two horizontal beams meaning less risk for Isaac and a bigger area for enemies to be hit.
