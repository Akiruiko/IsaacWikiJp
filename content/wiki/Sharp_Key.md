 # Sharp Key ![image](/image/Sharp_Key.png) 

Effects
---------


* Gives five [keys](/wiki/Keys "Keys").
* On use, Isaac holds a [key](/wiki/Key "Key") above his head. Pressing a fire button removes one key and throws it as a [piercing](/wiki/Tear_Effects#Effects "Tear Effects") projectile. The key damages enemies, as well as opens locked doors and [chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests") it hits.
	+ The key will also break the first [rock](/wiki/Rock "Rock") it hits, as well as [Key Blocks](/wiki/Blocks "Blocks").
	+ The thrown key does damage equal to 5x Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") + 30.
	+ Enemies killed by Sharp Key have a chance to spawn the contents of a chest; the contents they can drop includes the rewards of any possible chest contents, including items.


Notes
-------


* Thrown keys follow the same unlocking rules as [![image](/image/Dad%27s_Key.png)](/wiki/Dad%27s_Key "Dad's Key") [Dad's Key](/wiki/Dad%27s_Key "Dad's Key"): They can unlock [Secret Rooms](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room"), the doors to access [(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines"), [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum"), [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") in Mausoleum/Gehenna, [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan"), and the [Strange Door](/wiki/A_Strange_Door "A Strange Door"). However, it cannot be used as a substitute for [![image](/image/Red_Key.png)](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key") [Red Key](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key") or open the doors to [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") or [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)").
	+ Doors will be opened in one thrown key, even if they require multiple keys or bombs to open.
	+ The only rooms Dad's Key can open that Sharp Key cannot are [(Boss) Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room").
* Thrown keys can also destroy [Angel](/wiki/Angel "Angel") statues, but not [fire places](/wiki/Fire_Places "Fire Places").
* Thrown keys cannot pierce or destroy [Stoneys](/wiki/Fatty#Stoney "Fatty").
* Destroying a rock will create a bridge at the opposite side the thrown key hit the rock from.
* Despite being a substitute to bombs, thrown keys will not destroy [shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper").
* Thrown keys will open all the locked chests they move through, allowing multiple chests to be opened with a single key.
	+ Only locked chests (such as [Golden Chests](/wiki/Chests#Golden_Chest "Chests"), [Eternal Chests](/wiki/Chests#Eternal_Chest "Chests"), or [Old Chests](/wiki/Chests#Old_Chest "Chests")) can be opened by Sharp Key; all other chests are unaffected.
		- In the case of Eternal Chests, thrown keys will only count toward opening the chest one time.
	+ Opening locked chests with thrown keys in Challenge rooms will not cause the challenge room to start spawning enemies.
* Thrown keys will retain Isaac's [tear](/wiki/Tear_effects "Tear effects")/[status effects](/wiki/Status_Effects "Status Effects"), but are unaffected by items that replace Isaac's tears (such as [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"), [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"), or [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife")).
* Whether or not an enemy gives chest contents when killed by Sharp Key is seeded per enemy. As such, rooms can be re-entered (using Sharp Key itself or with [(Door Stop)](/wiki/Door_Stop "Door Stop") [Door Stop](/wiki/Door_Stop "Door Stop") / [![image](/image/Mercurius.png)](/wiki/Mercurius "Mercurius") [Mercurius](/wiki/Mercurius "Mercurius") etc.) before they're fully cleared to repeatedly get rewards from the same enemy.
* The type of chest that enemies will give the contents of is determined by standard chest generation rules. This makes the contents of standard chests more common, and prevents enemies from giving the contents of [Old chests](/wiki/Chests#Old_Chest "Chests") or [Mom's chest](/wiki/Chests#Mom.27s_Chest "Chests").
* The pickups enemies killed by Sharp Key can drop are affected by items/trinkets that modify chest spawns/rewards.


Synergies
-----------


* [(Ace of Spades)](/wiki/Ace_of_Spades "Ace of Spades") [Ace of Spades](/wiki/Ace_of_Spades "Ace of Spades") / [(Child's Heart)](/wiki/Child%27s_Heart "Child's Heart") [Child's Heart](/wiki/Child%27s_Heart "Child's Heart") / [(Lucky Toe)](/wiki/Lucky_Toe "Lucky Toe") [Lucky Toe](/wiki/Lucky_Toe "Lucky Toe") / [(Match Stick)](/wiki/Match_Stick "Match Stick") [Match Stick](/wiki/Match_Stick "Match Stick") / [(Rusted Key)](/wiki/Rusted_Key "Rusted Key") [Rusted Key](/wiki/Rusted_Key "Rusted Key") / [(Safety Cap)](/wiki/Safety_Cap "Safety Cap") [Safety Cap](/wiki/Safety_Cap "Safety Cap"): If an enemy drops pickups, it has a â…“ chance to drop an extra pickup; the pickup will be the one the trinket is associated with (random in the case of Lucky Toe).
* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns white wisps in the shape of keys, on the middle ring. Despite the wisps' appearance, they cannot unlock anything, and act as normal wisps with slightly less health. Due to a bug, Sharp Key can spawn wisps even if Isaac has no keys.
* [![image](/image/Continuum.png)](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum") [Continuum](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum"): Thrown keys can unlock doors they pass through after looping around the screen.
* [(Gilded Key)](/wiki/Gilded_Key "Gilded Key") [Gilded Key](/wiki/Gilded_Key "Gilded Key"): Enemies will only give the contents of locked chests. The pickups they can drop will also include [runes](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Runes "Cards and Runes") and [batteries](/wiki/Batteries "Batteries").
* [(The Left Hand)](/wiki/The_Left_Hand "The Left Hand") [The Left Hand](/wiki/The_Left_Hand "The Left Hand"): Enemies will only give the contents of red chests.
	+ As locked/red chests are able to give Items whereas normal chests cannot, the previous two trinkets also allow items to be obtained through Sharp Key more consistently.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Key.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Key "Mom's Key") [Mom's Key](/wiki/Mom%27s_Key "Mom's Key"): Doubles the amount of pickups dropped by enemies.
* [Angelic Prism](/wiki/Angelic_Prism "Angelic Prism"): A thrown key will duplicate into 4 keys, which can be used to open multiple rooms or chests with only 1 key. If Isaac stands at the middle far left or middle far right of the first room in [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)"), a thrown key can open all 4 chests.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Daemon's Tail)](/wiki/Daemon%27s_Tail "Daemon's Tail") [Daemon's Tail](/wiki/Daemon%27s_Tail "Daemon's Tail"): Enemies are much less likely to drop hearts; these hearts will still be [black hearts](/wiki/Hearts "Hearts").
* [![image](/image/Dead_Eye.png)](/wiki/Dead_Eye "Dead Eye") [Dead Eye](/wiki/Dead_Eye "Dead Eye"): Keys thrown will contribute to Dead Eye's damage modifier.
* [Golden Keys](/wiki/Keys "Keys"): Ignored by Sharp Key; it will still require and consume keys to use.
* [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Eye.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye") [Guppy's Eye](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye"): There will be no overlay on enemies that would drop pickups on death.
* [(Poker Chip)](/wiki/Poker_Chip "Poker Chip") [Poker Chip](/wiki/Poker_Chip "Poker Chip"): Enemies have a 50/50 chance to spawn extra pickups or an [Attack Fly](/wiki/Fly#Attack_Fly "Fly"): The attack fly will be instantly killed by the thrown key.
* [Spectral Tears](/wiki/Tear_Effects#Spectral "Tear Effects"): Rocks that thrown keys pass over have a chance of being destroyed. Key Blocks and doors are unaffected.


Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | If Isaac has [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Eye.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye") [Guppy's Eye](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye"), if an enemy drops chest contents on death, an overlay of the items they dropped will spawn where they died, which will persist until the room is cleared.
