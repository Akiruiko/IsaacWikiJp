 # Curved Horn ![image](/image/Curved_Horn.png) 

Effects
---------


* Increases [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") by 2, after normal calculations but before damage multipliers.


Notes
-------


* Normally, extra damage is reduced the more damage Isaac gets. Since Curved Horn is applied after every calculation, it will **always** be +2 damage.
* Picking up Curved Horn while having damage multipliers, like [(Magic Mushroom)](/wiki/Magic_Mushroom "Magic Mushroom") [Magic Mushroom](/wiki/Magic_Mushroom "Magic Mushroom") or [(Cricket's Head)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Head "Cricket's Head") [Cricket's Head](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Head "Cricket's Head"), makes Curved Horn even more beneficial from the multiplier (bringing, in the case of a x1.5 multiplier, the damage it grants to +3).
* Curved Horn's damage does not ignore damage reduction multipliers, such as [(Odd Mushroom)](/wiki/Odd_Mushroom_(Thin) "Odd Mushroom") [Odd Mushroom](/wiki/Odd_Mushroom_(Thin) "Odd Mushroom (Thin)") (damage * 0.9 - 0.4 damage down), (Removed in Repentance)[(Technology 2)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") (-35% damage down), and [(Soy Milk)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") (-80% damage down).
