 # Urn of Souls ![image](/image/Urn_of_Souls.png) 


Effects
---------


* Fires a single high-damage [piercing](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears") tear which can travel over [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacle "Obstacle").
	+ The damage dealt by this tear is ten times Isaac's damage, plus a flat 10 damage.
	+ The shot has an additional 1.5x size multiplier on top of damage-increased size.
* (Removed in Repentance) Sets Isaac's health to half a heart with each use (half a Soul Heart if these are present but there are no Red Heart containers). This also removes any other [(Soul Heart)](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") or [(Black Heart)](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart") [Black Hearts](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart"), but not [(Eternal Heart)](/wiki/Eternal_Heart "Eternal Heart") [Eternal Hearts](/wiki/Eternal_Heart "Eternal Heart").
	+ (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) If Isaac has no Red Hearts and at least one (Added in Afterbirth †) [(Bone Heart)](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart") [Bone Heart](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart"), only an empty Bone Heart remains.
* (Added in Repentance) Upon taking damage, this item turns into (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Broken_Glass_Cannon.png)](/wiki/Broken_Glass_Cannon "Broken Glass Cannon") [Broken Glass Cannon](/wiki/Broken_Glass_Cannon "Broken Glass Cannon"), and Isaac will lose an additional 2 hearts of health on top of the damage he already took. Isaac gains 1.5 range and leaves a trail of red [creep](/wiki/Creep "Creep") behind him, identical to the effects of [![image](/image/Anemic.png)](/wiki/Anemic "Anemic") [Anemic](/wiki/Anemic "Anemic") for the rest of the current room.
	+ If the damage from breaking Glass Cannon would result in death, Isaac will remain at half a heart, gaining half a soul heart if necessary. This does not apply if the damage Isaac took would be lethal before the extra damage is taken.
	+ Self-damage (e.g. from [(Blood Donation Machine.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/6/6e/Blood_Donation_Machine.png/revision/latest?cb=20210821075842) [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Machines#Blood_Donation_Machine "Machines")) will not break Glass Cannon.


Notes
-------


* Glass Cannon can be fired diagonally, even without (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Analog_Stick.png)](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick") [Analog Stick](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick").


* Shooting the Glass Cannon gives a slight [knockback](/wiki/Knockback "Knockback") effect to Isaac, which can be dangerous in rooms with obstacles like spikes or Fire Places.
* Getting hit while playing  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") will result into a second coin heart being damaged on top of the damage he already took.

The wisps shatter in one hit and their tears deal 8 damage per shot, but if one of the wisps is destroyed, all the others are also destroyed. Does not affect wisps other than ones made by this item. Despite Glass Cannon having a timed charge, the wisps persist between rooms.
* [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): The current charge of Chocolate Milk affects Glass Cannon.

* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Lachryphagy.png)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Glass Cannon will fire giant Lachryphagy tears. Tears are harder to feed as they will burst very quickly but they can be fed if you fire tears beforehand and then fire Glass Cannon into those tears.
* [![image](/image/Multidimensional_Baby.png)](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby"): The Glass Cannon tears will be doubled by Multidimensional Baby.

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Eye_of_the_Occult.png)](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult") [Eye of the Occult](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult"): Cannon shot can be controlled. If a synergy is given a crosshair (e.g. [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"), [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology") etc.), the tear will follow wherever it's pointed.

* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): As the Glass Cannon tears are so large, even a modest damage increase or a single tear size increasing item is likely to render the tear unable to damage enemies, their explosions too far from them.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Pluto.png)](/wiki/Pluto "Pluto") [Pluto](/wiki/Pluto "Pluto"): Allows Isaac to cross small gaps using the knockback of Glass Cannon.

The tears don't inherit [spectral](/wiki/Tear_Effects "Tear Effects") or [piercing](/wiki/Tear_Effects "Tear Effects").
* [![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): Reduces damage of shots, no effect on charge time.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Trisagion.png)](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion") [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion"): Fires normal Trisagion beams that do not have increased damage.
