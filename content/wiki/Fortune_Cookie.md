 # Fortune Cookie ![image](/image/Fortune_Cookie.png) 


Effects
---------


* Allows Isaac to carry two [cards or runes](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") at once. Cycle through cards by pressing the Control key (PC), R2 (PlayStation), RT (Xbox), or ZR (Switch, 3DS).
* Replaces all [pills](/wiki/Pills "Pills") with cards. Pills already on the ground will be converted to cards or runes upon picking up Starter Deck.
* Spawns a random [card](/wiki/Card "Card").
	+ (Added in Repentance) [Runes](/wiki/Rune "Rune"), [soul stones](/wiki/Soul_stone "Soul stone"), and other card-like consumables are also possible.


Notes
-------


* When picking up Starter Deck in a shop that has a pill for purchase, the pill can still be purchased and used. If the pill is dropped, it will be turned into a card.
* Picking up 2 Starter Decks won't allow you to carry 3 cards at once.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[![image](/image/Acid_Baby.png)](/wiki/Acid_Baby "Acid Baby") [Acid Baby](/wiki/Acid_Baby "Acid Baby"): Spawns cards or runes instead of pills. Using cards or runes will not trigger the room-wide poisoning effect.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Caffeine_Pill.png)](/wiki/Caffeine_Pill "Caffeine Pill") [Caffeine Pill](/wiki/Caffeine_Pill "Caffeine Pill"): A pill drops normally, but if it is picked up and dropped, or left on the ground while visiting other rooms, it becomes a card.
* [![image](/image/Little_Baggy.png)](/wiki/Little_Baggy "Little Baggy") [Little Baggy](/wiki/Little_Baggy "Little Baggy"): Overrides the effect of Little Baggy (switch from receiving only pills to only cards).
	+ (Added in Repentance) Having both items allow both cards and pills to appear again.
	+ Picking up Little Baggy while already holding Starter Deck will turn any held cards or runes into pills for one time.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Bottle_of_Pills.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Bottle_of_Pills "Mom's Bottle of Pills") [Mom's Bottle of Pills](/wiki/Mom%27s_Bottle_of_Pills "Mom's Bottle of Pills"): Gives a card instead of a pill, essentially becoming equivalent to a [![image](/image/Deck_of_Cards.png)](/wiki/Deck_of_Cards "Deck of Cards") [Deck of Cards](/wiki/Deck_of_Cards "Deck of Cards").
* (Added in Repentance)[(XIV - Temperance?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XIV - Temperance?") [XIV - Temperance?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Forces Isaac to eat pills even with Starter Deck.
