Notes[]
-------


* (Added in Repentance) Still allows for chest drops on [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)") even if not all conditions are met.
* The Glyph has no effect in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode") or Greedier Mode aside from Soul Hearts; champions still never drop anything.
* (Removed in Repentance) Because of how the item works in the priorities listed above, this item is not recommended for  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") (except in combination with [(Immaculate Conception)](/wiki/Immaculate_Conception "Immaculate Conception") [Immaculate Conception](/wiki/Immaculate_Conception "Immaculate Conception")) as he is always considered to be at half a Soul Heart, and all drops *from champions* are replaced with Soul Hearts.
* (Added in Repentance) [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") and  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") ignore both rules for Soul Heart generation. This prevents the item from generating mostly useless Soul Hearts.
* When playing as  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"), the priority of the drops is based on the active form's health: for example, if The Forgotten has half a red heart or less, but The Soul was active right before the pickup drop and it had more than 2 soul hearts, the Glyph will skip over the full red heart drops to the next condition. Also if The Forgotten is full on pickups and health, has a trinket but has less than 6 bone hearts, the Glyph will always drop soul hearts unless The Soul is active at the moment of the drop.
* (Added in Repentance) When playing as  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") /  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus"), the priority of the drops is based on the health of the character that has the Glyph.
* (Added in Repentance) When playing as  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus"), the room drop will be modified when the character switches to the character that has the item on room clear.
* (Added in Repentance) When playing as  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???"), all room drops will eventually be replaced by poop, as he is always considered to have less than 5 bombs. The first bomb condition is ignored.
	+ This does not happen if a Bombs Are Key pill has been used earlier when Tainted ??? had at least 5 keys, and drops will go forward to Trinkets like normal.
