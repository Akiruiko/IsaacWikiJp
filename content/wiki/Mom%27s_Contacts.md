 # Mom's Contacts ![image](/image/Mom%27s_Contacts.png) 

Effects
---------


* Adds a 20% chance to shoot [petrifying tears](/wiki/Petrification "Petrification"), which stop enemies in place and prevent them from moving or attacking.
* (Removed in Repentance) +0.25 [range](/wiki/Range "Range"). ((Removed in Afterbirth) not applied until the next time Isaac's range stat is updated).
* (Added in Repentance) +0.38 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
* +0.5 [tear height](/wiki/Tear_height "Tear height"). ((Removed in Afterbirth) not applied until the next time Isaac's tear height is updated).
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Yes Mother?](/wiki/Yes_Mother%3F "Yes Mother?") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into his mother.


Notes
-------


* The activation chance depends on the [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck") stat, and goes up to around 50% with approximately 20 luck.
* Petrifying a [Heart](/wiki/Mask_%2B_Heart "Mask + Heart") also freezes the Mask bound to it.
* Petrifying an enemy with a weak zone (Scolex or Carrion Queen) will make the enemy take damage anywhere while it is petrified, making combat significantly easier.

Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | Enemies with multiple segments ([Chub](/wiki/Chub "Chub"), [Pin](/wiki/Pin "Pin"), etc.) can be petrified and have their segments destroyed individually, but continue to live with any remaining health. This can be problematic at times especially with [Carrion Queen](/wiki/Carrion_Queen "Carrion Queen"), as you could destroy the "tail" or center body segment when Carrion Queen is petrified, thus making you have to petrify her again, or use bombs to do damage.
