Effects[]
---------


* In each room, the first enemy killed will release a gas explosion and [poison](/wiki/Poison "Poison") nearby enemies.
	+ Poisoned enemies will also release gas upon death, spreading the effect.
		- Poisoned enemies do not need to die while the poison is still active to spread the effect.
	+ The effect will also activate if a [shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper") is destroyed before killing any enemies.
		- Re-entering a room and destroying another [shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper") inside it will trigger the effect for a second time.


Notes[]
-------


* The initial gas explosion deals 5 damage, and the poison deals Isaac's [tear damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") per tick, for 6 ticks.
* The gas explosion and poison can damage [friendly](/wiki/Friendly "Friendly") enemies.


Synergies[]
-----------
