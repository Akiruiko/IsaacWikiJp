Effects[]
---------


* Grants 2 [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Health#Soul_Hearts "Health").
* Replaces normal tears with blue diamond tears while Isaac has no damaged [Red Heart containers](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health") or [Bone Hearts](/wiki/Health#Bone_Hearts "Health").
	+ This includes whenever Isaac doesn't have any Red Heart containers.
	+ The coin health of  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") count as red heart containers for the purposes of this item.
* While the effect is active, grants double [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage"), (Removed in Repentance)+5.25 [range](/wiki/Range "Range"), (Added in Repentance)+1.50 [range](/wiki/Range "Range"), +0.5 tear height, and -0.30 [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed").
	+ The crown will glow blue while active; if inactive, it will appear grey.
* The effect will deactivate for the rest of the current room when damage is taken, regardless of Isaac's health.
	+ Fighting waves in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode") won't reactivate the crown.


Notes[]
-------


* Because the effect occurs if Isaac has no Red Heart containers at all, this is an extremely beneficial item for  [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)"),  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???"),  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"),  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost"), (Added in Repentance)  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas"),  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas"),  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") and  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten").
* Due to the fact that they will be at full health a larger portion of the time than most characters, this item is also very powerful for  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper").
* If the damage is lost with  [(Tainted Isaac)](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac"), he can pick up another item in the same room and then swap it back to refresh the effect. Holding onto pedestal generation like (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Mystery Gift)](/wiki/Mystery_Gift "Mystery Gift") [Mystery Gift](/wiki/Mystery_Gift "Mystery Gift") will allow him to place an item inside a difficult boss room and regain the bonus damage after being hit.
* Using [(XI - Strength)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XI - Strength") [XI - Strength](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") when already at a maximum 12 hearts, but having taken damage (hence visually having full maximum health) will not reactivate the item.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle"): This will block damage and keep Crown of Light active.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Rock Bottom)](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom") [Rock Bottom](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom"): While the diamond tear effect will disappear when Isaac is hit, the damage up will not be reverted.
