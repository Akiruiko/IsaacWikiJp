Effects[]
---------


* Upon use, it restarts the room and respawns all enemies. [Pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") or [Chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests") may be granted for clearing the room.


Notes[]
-------


* Has no effect in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode").
* Has no effect when used in a room that had no enemies, (Challenge Room) [Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room"), or (Boss Challenge Room) [Boss Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Boss_Challenge_Room "Boss Challenge Room").
* Will work in a (Mini-Boss Room) [Mini-Boss Room](/wiki/Mini-Boss_Room "Mini-Boss Room").
* When used in a (Boss Room) [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_Room "Boss Room"), (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room"), or (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room"), Isaac is teleported to another room on the floor, and the room he was in does not reset. The room Isaac teleports to will respawn enemies if it had them.
	+ (Added in Repentance) [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") fight will restart. If used while being chased by The Beast, the screen will keep scrolling until the Ultra Harbingers are defeated or the game is exited. This can cause a softlock during [Ultra Famine](/wiki/Ultra_Famine "Ultra Famine")'s second phase, as the head will be outside of the screen, unable to catch up. (Again, this can be fixed by exiting/continuing.)
		- If used while the screen turns white after defeating The Beast, the fight will restart, but the screen will remain white. Isaac can move and shoot, but the Pause Menu cannot be opened. The only way to exit this state is to be strong or lucky enough to kill all them, or to quit the game forcefully. Upon continuing the game, the fight will start normally again.
	+ (Added in Repentance) When used against [Dogma](/wiki/Dogma "Dogma"), an additional copy of Dogma will spawn regardless of the condition or phase of the first one.
		- This applies to D7 Wisps produced by the [(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues").
* (Removed in Repentance) When used in a (Secret Room) [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") that previously contained [Greed](/wiki/Greed "Greed") or [Super Greed](/wiki/Super_Greed "Super Greed"), the room becomes a regular Secret Room.
	+ (Added in Repentance) No longer rerolls the room into a regular Secret Room; instead respawns [Greed](/wiki/Greed "Greed") or [Super Greed](/wiki/Super_Greed "Super Greed") (depending on which one was present before).
* (Removed in Repentance) When used in a (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop") that previously contained [Greed](/wiki/Greed "Greed") or [Super Greed](/wiki/Super_Greed "Super Greed"), the Shop items will spawn. Rolling it again will cause new items to spawn on top of each other.
	+ (Added in Repentance) No longer spawns a regular Shop; instead Greed or Super Greed respawns.
* When used in a room with a [Champion](/wiki/Champion "Champion") enemy, the enemy will not respawn as a Champion.
* Can be used to generate infinite rewards with both [(9 Volt)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") and [(AAA Battery)](/wiki/AAA_Battery "AAA Battery") [AAA Battery](/wiki/AAA_Battery "AAA Battery") and/or (Added in Repentance)[(4.5 Volt)](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") [4.5 Volt](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") depending on the enemies in the room.
	+ If Isaac only has either [(9 Volt)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") or [(AAA Battery)](/wiki/AAA_Battery "AAA Battery") [AAA Battery](/wiki/AAA_Battery "AAA Battery"), rewards can still be endlessly generated in a quadruple-sized room or an L-shaped room.
* Enemies respawn exactly where they first spawned, even if that's where Isaac is standing, in which case Isaac will take damage immediately upon use of the D7. Right next to doors is usually a safe place to use it.
* (Added in Repentance) If used in the [Mirrored World](/wiki/Mirrored_World "Mirrored World") of [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") or [(Dross)](/wiki/Dross "Dross") [Dross](/wiki/Dross "Dross") II, the rooms will not only have their enemies respawn, but all the normal non-mirrored contents such as pickups are restored. Using it in the Shop causes it to be stocked normally, and additional uses will restock the Shop's contents, unlike normal Shops.
* (Added in Repentance) As  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"), enemies respawned by the D7 will drop the same type of coins as they had before using the D7. This can be used to quickly generate money from enemies that dropped high-value coins or greatly increase [Luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck") if an enemy dropped a Lucky Penny.


Synergies[]
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a six-sided grey die wisp on the middle ring. The wisps start gray; if the wisps get hit while theyâ€™re gray, they invoke the effect of the D7 in the current room and turn blue. Damage that turns the wisps from gray to blue is negated.
