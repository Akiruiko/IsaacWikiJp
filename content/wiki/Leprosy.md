* +0.5 [Damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
* x1.5 Damage multiplier.


Notes[]
-------


* The x1.5 damage multiplier does not stack with the x1.5 damage multiplier from [(Magic Mushroom)](/wiki/Magic_Mushroom "Magic Mushroom") [Magic Mushroom](/wiki/Magic_Mushroom "Magic Mushroom"), from the combination of [(The Book of Belial)](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") [The Book of Belial](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") and [(Blood of the Martyr)](/wiki/Blood_of_the_Martyr "Blood of the Martyr") [Blood of the Martyr](/wiki/Blood_of_the_Martyr "Blood of the Martyr"), or itself (by using an item such as (Added in Afterbirth)[(Diplopia)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia"), for example). However, it will stack with any other multipliers, such as [(Sacred Heart)](/wiki/Sacred_Heart "Sacred Heart") [Sacred Heart](/wiki/Sacred_Heart "Sacred Heart").
