	+ A maximum of three body parts can be active at once.
	+ The body parts will be destroyed after dealing 30 ticks of damage and/or blocking 3 shots.
	+ The body parts persist between floors.
	+ Body parts orbit on the same layer as [Blue Flies](/wiki/Blue_Fly "Blue Fly") and [Locusts](/wiki/Locusts "Locusts") do.
