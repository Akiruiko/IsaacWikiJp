 # Sumptorium ![image](/image/Sumptorium.png) 


Effect
--------


* Spawns six [(Troll Bomb)](/wiki/Troll_Bomb "Troll Bomb") [Troll Bombs](/wiki/Troll_Bomb "Troll Bomb"), usually near the center of the [room](/wiki/Room "Room").
* (Added in Afterbirth †) This item belongs to the [Bookworm](/wiki/Bookworm "Bookworm") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Bookworm.


Notes
-------


* This item can drop from [(Pride)](/wiki/Pride "Pride") [Pride](/wiki/Pride "Pride").
* Although visually unchanged, all passive [bomb](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb") effect items affect the spawned Troll Bombs unless otherwise noted.
* The Troll Bombs created by Anarchist Cookbook spawn in one at a time; if Isaac leaves the [room](/wiki/Room "Room") soon after using it, not all 6 Troll Bombs will spawn.
* Using this item without any blast protection is not always recommended as it is very easy to be caught in the blast.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns wisps in the center ring, looking like bombs. The wisps spawn [troll bombs](/wiki/Bombs "Bombs") when destroyed. These troll bombs will use Isaac's bomb synergies.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Mr._Mega.png)](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") [Mr. Mega](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega"): No effect.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Bomber_Boy.png)](/wiki/Bomber_Boy "Bomber Boy") [Bomber Boy](/wiki/Bomber_Boy "Bomber Boy"): Not recommended. The cross pattern explosion makes it very hard to avoid taking damage.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Scatter_Bombs.png)](/wiki/Scatter_Bombs "Scatter Bombs") [Scatter Bombs](/wiki/Scatter_Bombs "Scatter Bombs"): Not recommended. Each Troll Bomb will spawn several smaller bombs upon exploding, making it very hard to avoid taking damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) No visual change can be seen with the Troll Bombs, but the smaller bombs have the sprite of the smaller normal bombs.
