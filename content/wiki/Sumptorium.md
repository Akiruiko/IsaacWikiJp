 # Sumptorium ![image](/image/Sumptorium.png) 

Effects
---------


* When used by any character other than  [(Tainted Eve)](/wiki/Tainted_Eve "Tainted Eve") [Tainted Eve](/wiki/Tainted_Eve "Tainted Eve"), removes half a heart of health upon use and creates a Clot familiar.
	+ Blood clot familiars mimic Isaac's movement (including [flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight")), firing, and tear effects.
	+ Blood clot familiars will mimic many (all?) tear-altering items, such as [![image](/image/Spirit_Sword.png)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword").
	+ Holding down the swap button allows Isaac's to move independently from the blood clots.
		- The familiars have health and will be destroyed if they take enough damage. They start with 15 HP when spawned and slowly decay down to 1 HP (5 HP for non-red hearts) over time, similarly to Minisaacs from [Giant Cell](/wiki/Giant_Cell "Giant Cell").
			* They are immune to hazards such as [spikes](/wiki/Spikes "Spikes"), [fire places](/wiki/Fire_Places "Fire Places"), and lasers.
			* Enemies deal 1 point of contact and projectile damage to them when hit.
			* Isaac's [bombs](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb") and troll bombs deal 2 points of damage.
		- Draining health does not count as taking damage, so creating familiars will not trigger damage-activated effects.
* Each type of heart generates a different type of blood clot:

**For  [(Tainted Eve)](/wiki/Tainted_Eve "Tainted Eve") [Tainted Eve](/wiki/Tainted_Eve "Tainted Eve") only:**



* Passively, holding down the fire button will create blood clot familiars every two seconds and drain half a [heart](/wiki/Health "Health").
* Upon activation, Sumptorium destroys any remaining blood clots and heals Tainted Eve for the same type of hearts that were used to generate them. The blood clots deal 3x Tainted Eve's damage to enemies they pass through as they return.
	+ Should Tainted Eve have more blood clots than room in her health bar when doing this, all excess blood clots will drop next to her.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): It will create red wisps for every clot consumed, and they will disappear if she starts creating clots again. Soul charges cannot be used to create wisps.
* [![image](/image/Box_of_Friends.png)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends"): Cannot be used to duplicate clots.
* [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): No interaction.
* [(Lil Clot)](/wiki/Lil_Clot "Lil Clot") [Lil Clot](/wiki/Lil_Clot "Lil Clot"): The clot spawned by this trinket is its own separate clot variant although it functions the same as the red one. As such, it cannot be absorbed by Sumptorium.
* [![image](/image/Maggy%27s_Bow.png)](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Bow "Maggy's Bow") [Maggy's Bow](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Bow "Maggy's Bow"): Does not provide additional healing when absorbing clots.
* [![image](/image/My_Reflection.png)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection"): Clots' tears will be redirected to Isaac instead of returning back to them.
* [![image](/image/Tractor_Beam.png)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): Clots' tears will be fired from Isaac instead, and will stay within the tractor beam.
* [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): Absorbing this item will consume all clots made earlier, but will not generate new clots.
* [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): Clots made by Sumptorium will have a bone club as well. 2 red clots and 1 bone clot can be made with each full bone heart.
	+ The active character will create clots, leaving the other character's health intact.
	+ Switching to  [![image](/image/The_Soul.png)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)") can be used to create extra soul clots, and they will switch between the bone club and firing tears normally as well.
	+ In order to stop clots from moving while playing as  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"), it is needed to hold down Left CTRL/RT while switching to  [![image](/image/The_Soul.png)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)"), and vice-versa.
	+ Clots created while having the boomerang attack charged will instantly swing their bone, then hold their bone club like  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") does in the opposite direction until throwing their bone.
* [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"): Clots made by Sumptorium have a club too, but they are commanded by  [(Tainted Soul)](/wiki/Tainted_Soul "Tainted Soul") [Tainted Soul](/wiki/Tainted_Soul "Tainted Soul"), making it the only way to attack while moving freely.
* [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper")/ [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"): Clots made by Sumptorium will be red, and can not be consumed after using Sumptorium, but the clots have triple/quadruple shot respectively. Sumptorium will drain half a coin heart which is not usually seen for these characters.
* [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"): Sumptorium will only affect the brother whom it was given. Both brothers will generate clots at the same pace if given to both, but will only consume the clots from the brother that used the item.
* [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene"): Making clots drains Magdalene's health much quicker, and at 12 red hearts, it will only absorb most of the hearts due to the character's unique ability.
* [(Tainted Samson)](/wiki/Tainted_Samson "Tainted Samson") [Tainted Samson](/wiki/Tainted_Samson "Tainted Samson")/[![image](/image/Berserk!.png)](/wiki/Berserk! "Berserk!") [Berserk!](/wiki/Berserk! "Berserk!"): Clots made by Sumptorium will have a donkey jawbone while berserking too.
* [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel"): Clots made by Sumptorium will have an even thinner [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") attack, and will sneeze too.
* [(Lazarus)](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus") [Lazarus](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus")/[Revival Items](/wiki/Category:Revival_items "Category:Revival items"): Clots will be retained after losing the extra life.
* [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost")/ [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost"): Sumptorium kills The Lost and Tainted Lost immediately upon use.
* [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus"): Sumptorium will only start making clots depending on which version it was given. You can give  [(Dead Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus") [Dead Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus")'s health to  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") after using [![image](/image/Flip.png)](/wiki/Flip "Flip") [Flip](/wiki/Flip "Flip") just after using Sumptorium.
* [(Tainted Eden)](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden") [Tainted Eden](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden"): Clots made by Sumptorium are retained permanently after taking damage.


Synergies
-----------


* [(Baby-Bender)](/wiki/Baby-Bender "Baby-Bender") [Baby-Bender](/wiki/Baby-Bender "Baby-Bender"): Gives the clots homing shots.
* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Doubles the clots' size and damage.
* [(Forgotten Lullaby)](/wiki/Forgotten_Lullaby "Forgotten Lullaby") [Forgotten Lullaby](/wiki/Forgotten_Lullaby "Forgotten Lullaby"): Increases the clots' fire rate.
* [![image](/image/Sacrificial_Altar.png)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar") [Sacrificial Altar](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar"): Turns each clot into a penny.
* [![image](/image/Spin_to_Win.png)](/wiki/Spin_to_Win "Spin to Win") [Spin to Win](/wiki/Spin_to_Win "Spin to Win"): Makes the clots deal 6 contact damage.
* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): spawns a controllable ludo tear for each clot. moving the tear cluster is impractical as it requires charging the sumptorium summoning.
	+ [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") + [![image](/image/A_Lump_of_Coal.png)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal"): each ludo tear's damage is based off of the distance to it's corresponding clot.


Notes
-------


* The type of heart drained first is decided by the following order: Golden Hearts, Eternal Hearts, Rotten Hearts, Red Hearts, then the rightmost Soul, Black, or Bone Hearts.
* Clots from a previous run will carry over during a [RERUN](/wiki/RERUN "RERUN").
* Sumptorium can't spawn more than 64 clots at once.
	+ This limit is shared with blue flies and blue spiders. If there are multiple flies, spiders and clots on the screen at the same time, the limit will be 32 for the clots and 32 for the flies/spiders.
* Sumptorium cannot absorb more than 29 clots at once.
* Activating Sumptorium does not restore Tainted Eve's health immediately, as it is not restored until the recalled blood clots return to Eve.
* If the player obtains flight, the clots will hover instead of lay down on the floor.
* Clots scale with Isaac's size.
