 # Spindown Dice ![image](/image/Spindown_Dice.png) 


Effects
---------


* Spawns two items instead of one in each (Treasure Room) [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room"). Only one item can be chosen; the other disappears.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Two items won't be generated in small Treasure Rooms.
* If the Treasure Room has already been entered and the item was not taken, then picking up More Options later on the same floor will not retroactively add a second item to the room.
* The very rare Treasure Rooms that have either no item or two items that can *both* be picked up will be replaced with a one-out-of-two choice room, like other treasure rooms. In the latter case, this is a downgrade.
* (Added in Repentance) In [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour"), [(Dross)](/wiki/Dross "Dross") [Dross](/wiki/Dross "Dross"), [(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines"), [(Ashpit)](/wiki/Ashpit "Ashpit") [Ashpit](/wiki/Ashpit "Ashpit"), [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum"), and [(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna"), Treasure Rooms will have two known and one unknown items, instead of the usual one known and one unknown.
* More Options will work for item rooms during the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent") as long as those rooms were never originally entered.
