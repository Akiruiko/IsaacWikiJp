Effects[]
---------


* Gives Isaac a flat [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") up based on how many empty [Heart containers](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health") he has.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The damage up given is 0.2 for each empty Red Heart container Isaac has.
		- (Added in Repentance) The damage up given is ((2 * MissingHearts) ^ 1.6) * 0.1, where MissingHearts is the number of full red hearts of health missing.
	+ Damage ups are only applied for every fully empty heart container.
* This item belongs to the [Spun](/wiki/Spun "Spun") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a buff berserker.


Notes[]
-------


* This item has no effect on characters that can't have any Red Heart containers, unless [(Bone Heart)](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart") [Bone Hearts](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart") are collected. If a Bone Heart is gone, so does the Adrenaline damage. This means that Adrenaline is only truly useless on  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost").
* This item affects both  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"); empty Coin Hearts increase damage.
* As  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"), empty Bone Hearts increase damage, but if the Bone Hearts are broken, the damage buff is taken away.


Synergies[]

* (Added in Repentance)[(Blood Oath)](/wiki/Blood_Oath "Blood Oath") [Blood Oath](/wiki/Blood_Oath "Blood Oath"): Activates the damage up effect of Adrenaline for the resulting empty heart containers at the start of each floor.
