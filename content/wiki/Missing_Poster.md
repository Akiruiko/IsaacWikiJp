 # Missing Poster ![image](/image/Missing_Poster.png) 

Effects
---------


* (Removed in Afterbirth) If Isaac dies to a (Sacrifice Room) [Sacrifice Room](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room")'s spikes, a puzzle piece will appear on his [last will](/wiki/Isaac%27s_last_will "Isaac's last will").
* (Added in Afterbirth) Dying in a (Sacrifice Room) [Sacrifice Room](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room") while holding it unlocks  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"). If The Lost is already unlocked, it instead revives Isaac as The Lost on death, then disappears.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) None of the effects will occur during any [Challenges](/wiki/Challenges "Challenges").
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) Resurrection items activate in a [set order](/wiki/Category:Revival_items "Category:Revival items"). Missing Poster has the lowest priority of all / (Added in Repentance) the second lowest priority of all, with only  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost")'s [(Birthright)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") effect being lower.
* (Added in Afterbirth) Also works while  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") is the one carrying it.
* (Added in Repentance) Missing Poster counts as an extra life for  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost"), rather than respawning him as his non-tainted counterpart.
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) The Lost will not carry [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") when revived into this way.
* (Added in Repentance) The Lost will carry [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") when revived into this way.
* If Isaac teleports out of the (Sacrifice Room) [Sacrifice Room](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room") before dying, The Lost will not be unlocked.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Afterbirth †) [Gulp!](/wiki/Gulp! "Gulp!") / (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Marbles)](/wiki/Marbles "Marbles") [Marbles](/wiki/Marbles "Marbles") / (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Smelter)](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter"): Missing Poster functions correctly after being consumed, but still disappears after activating.
* (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost"): Revived as Tainted Lost instead of The Lost.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Birthright)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright"):  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost")'s Birthright effect will apply after respawning as him, even if Birthright was obtained prior to dying.
