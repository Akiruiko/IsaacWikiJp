 # Tiny Planet ![image](/image/Tiny_Planet.png) 

Effects
---------


* [Range](/wiki/Range "Range") greatly increased.
* +7 [tear height](/wiki/Tear_height "Tear height").
* Grants [spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears").
* Tears now revolve around Isaac at a fixed distance until they hit the ground.
* (Added in Repentance) The tears orbit close to Isaac, offset slightly in the direction fired. Changing the firing direction will redirect all previously fired tears


Notes
-------


* Tears will not hit directly in front of Isaac; aiming directly away from enemies is often effective.
* (Added in Repentance) It is possible to control the direction of Tiny Planet with the mouse. On Windows, go to `C:/Users/[username]/Documents/My Games/The Binding Of Isaac [Rebirth/Afterbirth/Afterbirth+]/` and in the options.ini file, change the line that says `MouseControl=0` to `MouseControl=1`. Unlike normal controls, the mouse allows diagonal direction


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/20/20.png)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20"): Each shot fires two tears in opposing orbital directions.


* [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel"): Increases Azazel's range with Brimstone, and wraps the beam around the character.

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Eye_of_Belial.png)](/wiki/Eye_of_Belial "Eye of Belial") [Eye of Belial](/wiki/Eye_of_Belial "Eye of Belial"): After piercing an enemy, instead of homing in on enemies, tears will continue to orbit, but each tear can pierce multiple enemies to gain more size and damage multipliers.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Flat_Stone.png)](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone") [Flat Stone](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone"): Tears will bounce and orbit around the character.
* [![image](/image/Godhead.png)](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead") [Godhead](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead"): Tears with damaging auras orbit the character, creating a damaging barrier.

* [![image](/image/Lost_Contact.png)](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact") [Lost Contact](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact"): Shielded tears will orbit Isaac, granting a partially successful 360-degree projectile protection around him. Works better with a faster fire rate.
* [![image](/image/A_Lump_of_Coal.png)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal"): This item drastically increases the screen time of tears because it makes them orbit around Isaac for a few seconds. A Lump Of Coal adds a lot of damage to tears in "outer orbit".
	+ the tears do not fall during the beast fight allowing tears to grow bigger and bigger
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Marked.png)](/wiki/Marked "Marked") [Marked](/wiki/Marked "Marked"): Isaac will continuously fire orbiting tears, which allows him to not touch the attack keys and focus just on moving (with giant tears it makes it hard to see as he can't stop firing).

* [![image](/image/Rubber_Cement.png)](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement") [Rubber Cement](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement"): Tears bounce off enemies then keep orbiting Isaac. Very powerful as the tears are not destroyed upon damaging an enemy. When near walls, the orbiting tears tend to get stuck against the walls until Isaac moves away.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spirit_Sword.png)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword"): The sword's melee attack becomes disjointed from Isaac, hitting in an increased range in front of him but creating a blind spot where the strike used to be. Spin attacks also occur in front of Isaac instead of around him. Sword projectiles orbit around Isaac as normal.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Tainted Lilith)](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith") [Tainted Lilith](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith"): Tears orbit around the (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Gello.png)](/wiki/Gello "Gello") [Gello](/wiki/Gello "Gello") instead of the character.
* [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"): A laser creates a circle around Isaac's body before being fired forward normally. The laser becomes spectral.

* [(Ring Worm)](/wiki/Ring_Worm "Ring Worm") [Ring Worm](/wiki/Ring_Worm "Ring Worm"): Every single tear spins uncontrollably fast, making aiming incredibly difficult.
