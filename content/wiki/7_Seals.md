 # 7 Seals ![image](/image/7_Seals.png) 


Effects
---------


* Replaces the character's right eye tears with an unlimited range [piercing](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears") laser which fires continuously, dealing damage 15 times per second.
* (Removed in Repentance) x0.65 Damage multiplier.
* (Removed in Repentance) The laser deals 20% of Isaac's damage per tick.
	+ This compounds with the damage down for a total of 13% of Isaac's damage per tick.
* (Added in Repentance) Only the laser deals 13% of Isaac's damage per tick.
* (Added in Repentance) Tears fired per second * (2/3).
* (Added in Repentance) Laser is able to knock back enemies.


Notes
-------


* Tear delay is effectively doubled, as Isaac will do a bit of the animation to fire a right eye tear, but no tear will come out.
	+ (Added in Repentance) This applies to items that replace Isaac's tears, such as [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") and [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone").
* Charged shots are not affected by the effective tear delay down, as they don't use the alternative left eye/right eye fire scheme.
* (Removed in Repentance) As  [(Cain)](/wiki/Cain "Cain") [Cain](/wiki/Cain "Cain") can only fire tears from his right eye, Technology 2 will replace his tears altogether unless he has [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology") or a charged attack.
	+ (Added in Repentance) When used by Cain, or a character that is forced to fire from one eye due to the effects of [![image](/image/Stapler.png)](/wiki/Stapler "Stapler") [Stapler](/wiki/Stapler "Stapler") or [![image](/image/Lead_Pencil.png)](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil") [Lead Pencil](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil"), they will fire [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology") lasers out of their right eye instead of their normal tears, as long as they have no other items that replace their tears. These lasers cannot be angled with momentum.
* Because  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") is blindfolded and relies on her (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Incubus.png)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus"), the only effect gained from Technology 2 is the (Removed in Repentance) damage down (Added in Repentance) tears down.
	+ Unlike regular Lilith,  [(Tainted Lilith)](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith") [Tainted Lilith](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith") gains the standard laser from her head as well as the tears from the demonic baby.
* The laser can apply [status effects](/wiki/Status_effect "Status effect") very efficiently due to its high tick rate.
