Notes
-------


* This item is not in any item pool and is set to be hidden from appearing in any normal scenario. The only way to obtain it is by picking up [![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") as  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") which will give Tainted Forgotten the item in the consumable slot.
	+ It can, however, activate when using [![image](/image/Metronome.png)](/wiki/Metronome "Metronome") [Metronome](/wiki/Metronome "Metronome"). This does nothing with most characters, however it *will* return  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten")'s body to him if it is activated.
* Re-rolling Birthright via [![image](/image/D4.png)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4"), [![image](/image/D100.png)](/wiki/D100 "D100") [D100](/wiki/D100 "D100") or similar items will not remove Recall from the consumable slot.
* The item cannot be used while the Soul is holding the body or the body is traveling after it has been thrown. Trying to use it will not waste its charge.
* Obtaining Recall on any other character has no effect.
