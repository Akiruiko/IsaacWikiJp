 # RC Remote ![image](/image/RC_Remote.png) 

Effects
---------


* Instead of trailing behind Isaac, [familiars](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") are directly controlled by the same inputs as Isaac's.
* Holding the drop button will allow Isaac to move while keeping the familiars in place, identical to  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau").


Synergies
-----------


* [(King Baby)](/wiki/King_Baby "King Baby") [King Baby](/wiki/King_Baby "King Baby"): Familiars are not held in place while firing but still auto targets enemies, making this a great synergy.


* [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith"): [(Incubus)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") can be positioned on top of Lilith, effectively removing Lilith's downside.
