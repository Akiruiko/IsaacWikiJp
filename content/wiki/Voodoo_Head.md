Effects
---------


* Isaac uses a shield to block shots.

Notes
-------


* The shield can block diagonally by holding down 2 arrow keys at once.
	+ Tears will be fired vertically while the shield is at an angle.
* The shield can't block beams or explosions.
* The shield can be held in any direction if you're using a joystick.
* Many items change the shield's color as if were it's a tear or another weapon, but the change is only cosmetic.
* When using Tainted Forgotten, the shield goes on the bone pile and not the soul, so be careful.
