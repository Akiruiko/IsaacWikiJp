Notes
-------


* Knowing most item effects is very important for Apollyon, as you want to know whether or not to absorb something.
* [![image](/image/The_Battery.png)](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery") [The Battery](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery") and [![image](/image/Charged_Baby.png)](/wiki/Charged_Baby "Charged Baby") [Charged Baby](/wiki/Charged_Baby "Charged Baby") allow [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void") to be used twice consecutively without going into other rooms. This is helpful if you want to use [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void") to fight the boss and then absorb the item after defeating it after all rooms have been cleared, or when a Devil/Angel Room spawns after defeating the boss and you do not have [![image](/image/Goat_Head.png)](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head") [Goat Head](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head") or [![image](/image/Eucharist.png)](/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist") [Eucharist](/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist").
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/There%27s_Options.png)](/wiki/There%27s_Options "There's Options") [There's Options](/wiki/There%27s_Options "There's Options") and [![image](/image/More_Options.png)](/wiki/More_Options "More Options") [More Options](/wiki/More_Options "More Options") are amazing items for Apollyon, as they give the opportunity to absorb twice as many items that could increase his stats or add to his actives collection.
* (Added in Repentance) Absorbing passive items from a room with choice pedestals will count as absorbing only one of them, this includes pedestals added by [![image](/image/There%27s_Options.png)](/wiki/There%27s_Options "There's Options") [There's Options](/wiki/There%27s_Options "There's Options") and [![image](/image/More_Options.png)](/wiki/More_Options "More Options") [More Options](/wiki/More_Options "More Options"). Choice rooms can still be effective for copying active item effects, however.
* (Added in Repentance) Void can be used during the 'item get' animation to absorb the held item. This allows Apollyon to absorb undesirable devil and shop items, albeit by paying their cost first. It can also be used on items formerly unidentified due to the [Curse of the Blind](/wiki/Curses "Curses") (Pausing is recommended right after picking up the item to properly check what it is before absorbing it or not).
* Finding a [Library](/wiki/Library "Library") can be very powerful as Apollyon can use [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void") to gain numerous amounts of active effects from one room.
	+ However, it is not recommended to absorb a few books for the following reasons:
		- [![image](/image/The_Bible.png)](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") [The Bible](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") will instantly kill you if used while fighting [Satan](/wiki/Satan "Satan"). However, taking it is fine as long as you don't forget you have it or aren't fighting him.
		- (Added in Repentance) [![image](/image/Satanic_Bible.png)](/wiki/Satanic_Bible "Satanic Bible") [Satanic Bible](/wiki/Satanic_Bible "Satanic Bible") replaces the boss item with a Devil Deal, which could be bad if low on health. Devil deals also cannot be absorbed until they've been paid for.
		- [![image](/image/How_to_Jump.png)](/wiki/How_to_Jump "How to Jump") [How to Jump](/wiki/How_to_Jump "How to Jump") causes a sudden movement, which can potentially throw you into an enemy or trap you behind rocks (the latter can be fixed by leaving the run and continuing).
		- (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") is treated as a passive item if absorbed by Void. It's much better to take Book of Virtues and gain the passive wisp effect over a minor stat boost.
	+ It's also a good idea to touch at least three books if possible before using Void, to get the free [Bookworm](/wiki/Bookworm "Bookworm") transformation.


Item Interactions
-------------------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright"): Using [Void](/wiki/Void "Void") has a chance to spawn an item previously destroyed by it while keeping the bonus stats. The more items absorbed into [Void](/wiki/Void "Void") the higher chance for an item to spawn upon activation. Has no effect if [Void](/wiki/Void "Void") is not held.
