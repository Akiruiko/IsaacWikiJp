 # Maggy's Faith ![image](/image/Maggy%27s_Faith.png) 

Effects
---------


* Gives an [eternal heart](/wiki/Health#Eternal_Hearts "Health") at the start of every floor.


Notes
-------


* The eternal heart is added directly to Isaac's heart containers, as opposed to appearing as a pickup.
* The effect will also be triggered when the floor is reset (for example, with [(Forget Me Now)](/wiki/Forget_Me_Now "Forget Me Now") [Forget Me Now](/wiki/Forget_Me_Now "Forget Me Now")).
* [(Eden)](/wiki/Eden "Eden") [Eden](/wiki/Eden "Eden") will not be given the eternal heart on the first floor if they start with this trinket.
* (Added in Afterbirth â€ ) When held as  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"), the eternal heart will be given to whichever character is being controlled when entering the next floor.
* (Added in Repentance) When going though the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent"), eternal hearts will be given for each floor traveled up.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Glowing Hour Glass)](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass") [Glowing Hour Glass](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass"): Eternal hearts will persist if the item is immediately used on the next floor, allowing for another eternal heart for free.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Mom's Box)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box") [Mom's Box](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box"): Grants two eternal hearts at the start of each floor, which is equivalent to gaining a full heart container every floor.


Bugs
