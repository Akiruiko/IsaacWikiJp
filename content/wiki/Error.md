 # Error ![image](/image/Error.png) 

Effects
---------


* Gives a random [trinket](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket") effect for each room.
	+ There is no indication as to which trinket effect Isaac gets.


Notes
-------


* Each room is locked to a single trinket effect, meaning that even if Isaac exits and re-enters a room, that room will always have the same trinket effect.
* In rooms where the [![image](/image/Tick.png)](/wiki/Tick "Tick") [Tick](/wiki/Tick "Tick") effect is given, Isaac is unable to swap Error with another trinket.
* If the [![image](/image/Store_Credit.png)](/wiki/Store_Credit "Store Credit") [Store Credit](/wiki/Store_Credit "Store Credit") effect is given in a Shop, all items will be free and Error will not be consumed.
* If the [![image](/image/Monkey_Paw.png)](/wiki/Monkey_Paw "Monkey Paw") [Monkey Paw](/wiki/Monkey_Paw "Monkey Paw") effect is given, Error will never be consumed and can continue to spawn Black Hearts indefinitely.
* If the (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Walnut.png)](/wiki/Walnut "Walnut") [Walnut](/wiki/Walnut "Walnut") effect is given, the trinket will not be consumed and will continue to spawn [items](/wiki/Items "Items") upon taking damage.
	+ Touching a [Stoney](/wiki/Stoney "Stoney") and [Movable TNT](/wiki/Movable_TNT "Movable TNT") counts as taking damage and will spawn a lot of items.
* If the (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Your_Soul.png)](/wiki/Your_Soul "Your Soul") [Your Soul](/wiki/Your_Soul "Your Soul") effect is given, all Devil Deals will be free and Error will not be consumed.
* Error can not give the effects of trinkets Isaac is currently holding (with [(Mom's Purse)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Purse "Mom's Purse") [Mom's Purse](/wiki/Mom%27s_Purse "Mom's Purse") or (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Belly Button)](/wiki/Belly_Button "Belly Button") [Belly Button](/wiki/Belly_Button "Belly Button")) or ones that were [gulped](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter").
	+ Therefore, somehow gulping all the trinkets in one run will make this trinket useless.
