 # Meat Cleaver ![image](/image/Meat_Cleaver.png) 

Effects
---------


* Upon use, splits enemies in the room into two smaller versions with ~40% health each.
	+ Normal enemies can be split twice, while [champions](/wiki/Champion "Champion") and bosses can be split three times. If an enemy cannot be split, they instead take 25 damage.
	+ If the enemy splits as part of their mechanic, such as [Squirt](/wiki/Squirt "Squirt"), [Teratoma](/wiki/Teratoma "Teratoma"), or [The Fallen](/wiki/The_Fallen "The Fallen"), they will instead take the damage required to split them.
	+ If the enemy has segments, such as [Larry Jr.](/wiki/Larry_Jr. "Larry Jr."), they will have their segments cut down to half, rounding down.
	+ If the enemy has a cable between them, such as [Mr. Maw](/wiki/Mr._Maw "Mr. Maw"), it will immediately be cut. Mr. Maws specifically will be left with just their head.


Notes
-------


* Invincible enemies, such as [Stone Grimaces](/wiki/Stone_Grimace "Stone Grimace") and lowered [Hosts](/wiki/Host "Host"), will not be split.
* Multi-segmented enemies will only take damage on one segment.
* [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart"), [It Lives](/wiki/It_Lives "It Lives"), [Isaac](/wiki/Isaac_(Boss) "Isaac (Boss)"), [Satan](/wiki/Satan "Satan"), [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Boss) "??? (Boss)"), [The Lamb](/wiki/The_Lamb "The Lamb"), [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan"), [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush"), [Ultra Greed](/wiki/Ultra_Greed "Ultra Greed"), [Mother](/wiki/Mother "Mother"), [Dogma](/wiki/Dogma "Dogma"), [Ultra Famine](/wiki/Ultra_Famine "Ultra Famine"), [Ultra Pestilence](/wiki/Ultra_Pestilence "Ultra Pestilence"), [Ultra War](/wiki/Ultra_War "Ultra War"), [Ultra Death](/wiki/Ultra_Death "Ultra Death"), and [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") cannot be split.
* Unlike other enemies, [Delirium](/wiki/Delirium "Delirium") has no limit on how many times it can be split with Meat Cleaver.
* [Gemini](/wiki/Gemini "Gemini") will immediately separate in two, resulting in Suture being enraged even if no damage has been dealt otherwise.
* Using it on [Loki](/wiki/Loki "Loki") will turn him into [Lokii](/wiki/Lokii "Lokii").
* Using it on [Carrion Queen](/wiki/Carrion_Queen "Carrion Queen"), [Chub](/wiki/Chub "Chub"), or [C.H.A.D.](/wiki/C.H.A.D. "C.H.A.D.") will split them into two one-segmented pieces, instantly killing both halves.
* Using it on [Gabriel or Uriel](/wiki/Angel "Angel") will cause them to drop [key piece 1](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1") and [key piece 2](/wiki/Key_Piece_2 "Key Piece 2") (killing them both without picking up a key piece can result in getting the same key piece twice).


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns one red wisp on the middle ring on use. Before spawning wisps, Meat Cleaver divides all of Isaac's wisps into two wisps that have half health and deal half tear damage. Wisps will be destroyed if they try to divide a third time.
* [(Filigree Feather)](/wiki/Filigree_Feather "Filigree Feather") [Filigree Feather](/wiki/Filigree_Feather "Filigree Feather"): Each split angel will drop an item.
* [![image](/image/Lusty_Blood.png)](/wiki/Lusty_Blood "Lusty Blood") [Lusty Blood](/wiki/Lusty_Blood "Lusty Blood"): Each split enemy killed grants a damage boost.
* [(Sigil of Baphomet)](/wiki/Sigil_of_Baphomet "Sigil of Baphomet") [Sigil of Baphomet](/wiki/Sigil_of_Baphomet "Sigil of Baphomet"): Split enemies will allow the shield to activate and stack up more easily.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Blood_Puppy.png)](/wiki/Blood_Puppy "Blood Puppy") [Blood Puppy](/wiki/Blood_Puppy "Blood Puppy"): If Blood Puppy is angry, splits it into two copies. One copy can level up and be tamed like normal, but the other cannot level up and dies instead of being tamed.
