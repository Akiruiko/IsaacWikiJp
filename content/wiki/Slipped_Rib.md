 # Slipped Rib ![image](/image/Slipped_Rib.png) 


Effects
---------


* Spawns a bone [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that circles around Isaac and reflects enemy shots.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The reflected projectiles deal 5 damage if they would've hurt Isaac for half a heart, and 10 for a full heart.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The reflected projectiles deal 6 damage if they would've hurt Isaac for half a heart, and 7 for a full heart.
	+ Enemy damage modification from item effects or by stage does not affect the reflected damage.
	+ Reflected projectiles do not gain [Tear effects](/wiki/Tear_effects "Tear effects") from Isaac.
		- Explosive projectiles (e.g. from [(Gurgle)](/wiki/Gaper#Gurgle "Gurgle") [Gurgle](/wiki/Gaper#Gurgle "Gaper")) explode as normal, dealing as much damage they would've.
		- Projectiles that create other projectiles (e.g. (Added in Repentance) [(Shady)](/wiki/Fatty#Shady "Shady") [Shady](/wiki/Fatty#Shady "Fatty")) can harm Isaac and be reflected.
		- Homing projectiles (e.g. from [(Psychic Horf)](/wiki/Horf#Psychic_Horf "Psychic Horf") [Psychic Horf](/wiki/Horf#Psychic_Horf "Horf")) do not retain their homing effect after being reflected.
	+ Can reflect:
		- Fire projectiles (e.g. from [(Mega Satan)](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan")).
		- Obstacles thrown by (Added in Repentance) [(Polty)](/wiki/Polty "Polty") [Polty](/wiki/Polty "Polty") or (Added in Repentance) [(Kineti)](/wiki/Polty#Kineti "Kineti") [Kineti](/wiki/Polty#Kineti "Polty"), dealing a flat 35 damage.
	+ Does not reflect:
		- Lasers or beams.
		- Lines of fire (e.g. from (Added in Repentance) [(Dragon Fly)](/wiki/Boom_Fly#Dragon_Fly "Dragon Fly") [Dragon Fly](/wiki/Boom_Fly#Dragon_Fly "Boom Fly")), but can reflect fireballs (e.g. from (Added in Repentance) [(Crackle)](/wiki/Gaper#Crackle "Crackle") [Crackle](/wiki/Gaper#Crackle "Gaper")) and their lines of fire do not harm Isaac.
		- Projectiles from (Added in Repentance) [(Big Bony)](/wiki/Fatty#Big_Bony "Big Bony") [Big Bony](/wiki/Fatty#Big_Bony "Fatty"), (Added in Repentance) [(Coal Boy)](/wiki/Danny#Coal_Boy "Coal Boy") [Coal Boy](/wiki/Danny#Coal_Boy "Danny"), (Added in Repentance) [(Danny)](/wiki/Danny "Danny") [Danny](/wiki/Danny "Danny").
	+ The familiar does not deal contact damage, but kills the same types of [flies](/wiki/Flies "Flies") on contact as [Pretty Fly](/wiki/Pretty_Fly "Pretty Fly") orbitals do.


Notes
-------


* (Added in Repentance) Despite being an orbital familiar, it is not in the list of items which  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") cannot find in regular item pools.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Increases its size but does not increase the hitbox or the reflected damage.
