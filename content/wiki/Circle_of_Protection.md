Effects[]
---------


* Initiates the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent") sequence.


Notes[]
-------


* Dad's Note cannot be rerolled or destroyed in most ways, such as with [(The D6)](/wiki/The_D6 "The D6") [The D6](/wiki/The_D6 "The D6"), [(Void)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"), or [(Abyss)](/wiki/Abyss "Abyss") [Abyss](/wiki/Abyss "Abyss").
* Dad's Note cannot be duplicated via [(Crooked Penny)](/wiki/Crooked_Penny "Crooked Penny") [Crooked Penny](/wiki/Crooked_Penny "Crooked Penny"), even if other items in the same room would be duplicated. Other duplication items such as [(Diplopia)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") work as normal.
* The boss room containing Dad's Note cannot be exited once entered, similar to the [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom") boss fight. The only way to exit is through teleportation.
* The only item that can be taken in the boss room of this special version of [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum")/[(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") is Dad's Note. No other items will be spawned.
	+ [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room") and [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop") will still generate in this special floor as in usual floors, giving Isaac more options.
	+ [(Lemegeton)](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") [Lemegeton](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") pulls from the [Boss Pool](/wiki/Boss_(Item_Pool) "Boss (Item Pool)") when used.
	+ In [Co-Op](/wiki/Repentance_Co-Op "Repentance Co-Op"), extra boss items will still spawn for other players. These should be picked up quickly before the Ascent sequence begins.
* The Treasure Room of this floor works as expected, containing one visible item and one blind item. During the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent"), both items will be visible. It is recommended to wait to choose an item until the Ascent has started.
	+ [(Dream Catcher)](/wiki/Dream_Catcher "Dream Catcher") [Dream Catcher](/wiki/Dream_Catcher "Dream Catcher") can circumvent this by showing both items in the floor transition.
* If Dad's Note is obtained outside of the special boss room via cheats or by using [(Spindown Dice)](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") [Spindown Dice](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") on [(Sausage)](/wiki/Sausage "Sausage") [Sausage](/wiki/Sausage "Sausage"), the music will slowly fade out, but the Ascent will not start.
