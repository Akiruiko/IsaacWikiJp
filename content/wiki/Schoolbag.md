	+ The attack can be released only when fully charged.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Tears down: Delay * 4.3.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Fire rate is divided by 4.3 (roughly 0.23x).
	+ Each tear has a random size multiplier between 0.9x to 1.33x, but there is no effect on damage.

* [(20/20)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") / [(The Inner Eye)](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") [The Inner Eye](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") / [(Mutant Spider)](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") [Mutant Spider](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider"): Adds 2, 5 or 7 tears to the barrage respectively. For the latter two, greatly slows down the charge.
	+ **20/20** + **The Inner Eye**: 10 extra tears.
	+ **20/20** + **Mutant Spider**: 14 extra tears.
	+ **The Inner Eye** + **Mutant Spider**: 14 extra tears.
	+ **All three**: 19 extra tears.
* [(Anti-Gravity)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): overidden, but tear delay down still applies, which greatly reduced the charge time, leading to better damage output.
* [(Blood Clot)](/wiki/Blood_Clot "Blood Clot") [Blood Clot](/wiki/Blood_Clot "Blood Clot"): All tears are larger, with increased damage (as opposed to every 2nd tear like Blood Clot alone)
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) Tears have a 50% chance to be Blood Clot tears.
* (Added in Afterbirth) [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Fires 3-5 additional Brimstone lasers in random directions around Isaac. It does not increase the charge time. This effect also applies to  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") and (Added in Repentance) [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel")'s versions of Brimstone.
	+ + (Added in Repentance)[(Eye Sore)](/wiki/Eye_Sore "Eye Sore") [Eye Sore](/wiki/Eye_Sore "Eye Sore") Not recommended. Overrides this synergy with a chance to shoot 1-3 additional Brimstone lasers in random directions.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Soy Milk)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): Continuously fires shotgun-style tears without the need to release the attack button, resulting in a significant damage per second increase.
* [(Chocolate Milk)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): Reduces Isaac's tear delay by 20%, and each tear from Monstro's Lung is a charged Chocolate Milk shot, massively increasing fire rate and damage.
	+ This does not apply to  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith")'s Incubus; picking up Chocolate Milk will significantly reduce damage and increase charge time.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Tear delay is increased, and the tear damage, along with the amount of tears fired is dependent on charge time.
* (Added in Afterbirth) [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Isaac spits multiple bombs but must charge to fire. Bombs detonate simultaneously.
* (Added in Afterbirth) [(Epic Fetus)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Launches 3-5 cursors that rotate around each other before the missiles land.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Flat Stone)](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone") [Flat Stone](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone"): All tears bounce simultaneously; the effective range is greatly increased.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Ipecac)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Isaac spews multiple Ipecac tears, with no increase in charge time.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Isaac spews multiple Ipecac tears. Charge time is greatly increased.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"): Grants a charged shot, but rather than firing a cluster of tears, fires a cluster of zigzagging lasers in a short-range spread pattern.
	+ +[(Soy Milk)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): Continuously fires laser clusters without having to charge.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Tech X)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): Fires a group of laser rings with size dependent on how long they were charged, with increased charge time.
* (Added in Afterbirth) [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Tear becomes a cluster of variably sized tears spread over a small area. The tears move at the same speed when controlled but constantly move around each other.
* (Added in Afterbirth) [(Mom's Knife)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Fires an additional cluster of 3-5 knives when at maximum charge, each dealing 2x tear damage.
	+ With two copies of Monstro's Lung, throws a fan of four extra knives alongside the basic attack regardless of charge.
* (Removed in Afterbirth †) [(Mom's Wig)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Wig "Mom's Wig") [Mom's Wig](/wiki/Mom%27s_Wig "Mom's Wig"): All the spiders will spawn instantly while charging a shot.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Amount of spiders spawned dependent on luck.
* **Monstro's Lung**: Additional copies of the Lung add 10 tears to the barrage.
* [(My Reflection)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection"): Tears stay in the air much longer and consistently, allowing better reach and more focused blasts before the tears returning to Isaac.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Tractor Beam)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): All the tears follow the beam at different heights without spreading out, making it much easier for multiple tears to hit a target.

--------------


* (Removed in Afterbirth †) [(Chemical Peel)](/wiki/Chemical_Peel "Chemical Peel") [Chemical Peel](/wiki/Chemical_Peel "Chemical Peel"): Overridden by Monstro's Lung.

* (Removed in Afterbirth †) (Added in Afterbirth)[(Kidney Stone)](/wiki/Kidney_Stone "Kidney Stone") [Kidney Stone](/wiki/Kidney_Stone "Kidney Stone"): If Monstro's Lung is picked up while Kidney Stone is ready to fire, charge time for Monstro's Lung will be significantly decreased.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) Only stat effects from Kidney Stone apply.
* [(Loki's Horns)](/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns "Loki's Horns") [Loki's Horns](/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns "Loki's Horns")/[(Mom's Eye)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye") [Mom's Eye](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye"): Isaac will still fire single tears in the other direction(s).

	+ (Added in Afterbirth)Tear becomes a cluster of variably sized tears spread over a small area. The tears move at the same speed when controlled but constantly move around each other.

* [(Strange Attractor)](/wiki/Strange_Attractor "Strange Attractor") [Strange Attractor](/wiki/Strange_Attractor "Strange Attractor"): Due to the high concentration of tears enemies will be pulled into Isaac at great force, in certain cases enough force to pull enemies through rocks.

	+ (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) Charge effect is removed and fire rate returned to normal. Extra lasers will be shot in random directions around Isaac while firing.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Grants a charged shot, but rather than firing a cluster of tears, fires a cluster of zigzagging lasers in a short-range spread pattern.
