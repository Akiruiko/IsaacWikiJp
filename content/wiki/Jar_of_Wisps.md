 # Jar of Wisps ![image](/image/Jar_of_Wisps.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns a wisp that orbits Isaac, fires tears, blocks enemy shots, and deals contact damage to enemies, much like the ones spawned by [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues").
	+ The jar initially spawns only one wisp, but spawns an additional wisp each time the jar is used, up to a maximum of 12 per use. The amount of wisps that will be spawned by the jar is indicated by both a counter and the jar visually filling up with wisps.
* Isaac can have up to 3 rings of wisps; an inner, counter-clockwise spinning ring of 6 wisps, a center, clockwise-spinning ring of 8 wisps, and an outer, counter-clockwise spinning ring of 12 wisps, for a total of 26.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): The wisp amount spawned is doubled with one more added.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Only spawns one extra wisp per use, regardless of the current wisp count.
* [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): Will spawn only one wisp per use.


Notes
-------


* The wisps spawned by the jar can be ones created by any Book of Virtues synergy, although basic wisps are much more common than special variants.
* While most wisps that can be given act similarly to normal wisps, there are some with effects that can potentially harm Isaac.
	+ [![image](/image/Anarchist_Cookbook.png)](/wiki/Anarchist_Cookbook "Anarchist Cookbook") [Anarchist Cookbook](/wiki/Anarchist_Cookbook "Anarchist Cookbook") Wisps look like bombs and spawn [(Troll Bomb)](/wiki/Troll_Bomb "Troll Bomb") [Troll Bombs](/wiki/Troll_Bomb "Troll Bomb") when destroyed.
		- [![image](/image/Mama_Mega!.png)](/wiki/Mama_Mega! "Mama Mega!") [Mama Mega!](/wiki/Mama_Mega! "Mama Mega!") wisps look like gold tinted bombs, and will spawn [(Golden Troll Bomb)](/wiki/Golden_Troll_Bomb "Golden Troll Bomb") [Golden Troll Bombs](/wiki/Golden_Troll_Bomb "Golden Troll Bomb").
		- Bomb wisps with a gray tint are not dangerous; [![image](/image/Doctor%27s_Remote.png)](/wiki/Doctor%27s_Remote "Doctor's Remote") [Doctor's Remote](/wiki/Doctor%27s_Remote "Doctor's Remote") wisps only invoke their special effect when said item is used.
	+ Wisps that look like gray cubes will invoke the effect of the [![image](/image/D7.png)](/wiki/D7 "D7") [D7](/wiki/D7 "D7") when they take damage. If this happens during a Boss fight, Isaac will be teleported to a random room on the floor, which will have its enemies respawned.
		- [![image](/image/Teleport!.png)](/wiki/Teleport! "Teleport!") [Teleport!](/wiki/Teleport! "Teleport!")/[![image](/image/Teleport_2.0.png)](/wiki/Teleport_2.0 "Teleport 2.0") [Teleport 2.0](/wiki/Teleport_2.0 "Teleport 2.0") Wisps fade into and out of existence and have a chance to teleport non-boss enemies to a random spot in the current room when their tears hit them.
* Switching the jar with other active items and then picking it up again does not reset the number of wisps that will be spawned on use.
