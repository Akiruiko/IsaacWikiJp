Effects[]
---------


* When tears land on the "back" of enemies, they deal double [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") and inflict [bleeding](/wiki/Status_Effects#Bleed "Status Effects").
	+ Bleeding enemies take damage equal to 10% of their maximum health every 5 seconds.
	+ Bosses cannot be inflicted with bleeding, but will still take the extra damage.
	+ The extra damage is dealt even if the enemy is already bleeding.
