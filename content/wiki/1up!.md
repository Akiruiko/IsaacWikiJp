 # 1up! ![image](/image/1up!.png) 


Effects
---------


* On use, Isaac raises the candle above his head. On pressing a fire button, a red flame, similar to a [red fireplace](/wiki/Fire_Places "Fire Places"), will fire in the chosen direction.
	+ The flame deals 23 damage per tick, and can hit up to 5 times for a maximum of 115 damage per flame.
	+ The flame also destroys enemy shots it comes into contact with, which decreases its size each time being hit until the flame is entirely extinguished by this process.
* (Removed in Repentance) The flame projectile is persistent and will remain active in the [room](/wiki/Room "Room") until it deals a set amount of damage. It can pass over pits, but can not travel through [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles").
	+ (Added in Repentance) Flames will also disappear after 10 seconds.
* While Isaac holds the candle above his head, his movement speed is reduced.
* (Removed in Repentance) Flames remain active until depleted by dealing damage to enemies or upon changing rooms.
* (Removed in Repentance) There is no limit to the number of fires that can be active. This is useful in situations where mob spawning can be controlled: for example, beating [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") or [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode") as  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"). This is time-consuming but can be viable if your other sources of damage are weak or unreliable.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Boss behavior in Boss Rush is not as predictable as in the original game, so more fires must be placed around the room.
* (Removed in Repentance) It will block Isaac's tears but won't burn him. Isaac's tears can also shrink the size of the flame.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Flames do not block player shots, nor are they put out by them.
* Flames will destroy [shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper").
* (Added in Repentance) Flames will turn certain enemies (such as [Hoppers](/wiki/Hopper "Hopper") and [Clotties](/wiki/Clotty "Clotty")) into their flaming variants, making them stronger. The flame is unable to damage these monsters.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/9_Volt.png)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt"): Decreases cooldown.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns red wisps in the middle ring. The wisps shoot small flames instead of tears, with a very high tear delay; flames last for 5 seconds or until they block 2 shots and/or deal 2 ticks of damage. The wisps do not persist between rooms, and the damage they deal does not increase with [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") or scale up on later floors.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): No effect.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): When the fire hits the tear, the tear resets and appears again on the player.
