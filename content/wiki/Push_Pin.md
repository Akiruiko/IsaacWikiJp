* Adds a 10% chance to shoot a [piercing](/wiki/Tears#Piercing_Tears "Tears") and [spectral](/wiki/Tears#Spectral_Tears "Tears") tear.
* The activation chance depends on the [Luck](/wiki/Attributes#Luck "Attributes") stat. The activation rate is equal to 1/(10 - (Luck / 2)). At base luck (0), the chance is 10%, maxing out at 100% at 18 luck.
	+ Due to how this formula works, increases in activation rate are only seen with every 2 points of luck, as this formula rounds down after dividing Isaac's luck by 2.
