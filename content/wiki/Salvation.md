Effects[]
---------


* Isaac receives an angelic halo around him.
* When an enemy comes in contact with the halo, a beam of light starts to form above them. If they stay in the halo for about a second, a beam of light will strike down on them, dealing 3.5 damage and creating 4 more beams that shoot out in all cardinal directions.
	+ The initial beam of light does 3.5 damage per tick (up to 15 times) and the others deal 1.75 damage per tick (up to 15 times).
		- If an enemy is standing in the center of all the light beams, they will take a total of 152.5 damage.
* Each time Isaac takes damage, the halo will grow in size, up to a maximum of 10 times. The halo size will reset after leaving the floor.
* This item belongs to the [Seraphim](/wiki/Seraphim_(Transformation) "Seraphim (Transformation)") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into an angel.
