 # Broken Modem ![image](/image/Broken_Modem.png) 

Effects
---------


* Enemies, enemy shots, tears and pickups will briefly freeze in place at random intervals.
	+ The frequency of the effect depends on Isaac's [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").
	+ (Added in Repentance) Frozen enemy shots will disappear.
* Has a 25% chance to double the room drop, similar to [![image](/image/Contract_From_Below.png)](/wiki/Contract_From_Below "Contract From Below") [Contract From Below](/wiki/Contract_From_Below "Contract From Below").
	+ Unlike the Contract, the Broken Modem cannot double [chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest"), [pills](/wiki/Pill "Pill") or [cards](/wiki/Card "Card").
		- However, it *can* duplicate chests that are an alternate reward from (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Options%3F.png)](/wiki/Options%3F "Options?") [Options?](/wiki/Options%3F "Options?"). These chests will have different contents from each other.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Poke_Go.png)](/wiki/Poke_Go "Poke Go") [Poke Go](/wiki/Poke_Go "Poke Go"): The charmed enemies spawned by this item will also be affected by the modem.


Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | (Added in Repentance) If this item is rerolled ([![image](/image/D4.png)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4"), etc.) while the freezing effect is taking place in a room with enemies, those enemies will remain frozen permanently as long as Isaac remains in that room, making it a matter of time before the room is cleared. This includes bosses.[[1]](#cite_note-1) |
