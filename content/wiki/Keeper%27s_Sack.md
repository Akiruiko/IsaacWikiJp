Effects[]
---------


* When Isaac has no [Red Hearts](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health"):
	+ Grants [flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight").
	+ Every 40 seconds since activation or pickup, when the seconds on the timer hit 00, 20, or 40, while in a room with enemies, a [shield](/wiki/Shield "Shield") triggers, nullifying all types of damage for 10 seconds.
* Grants 2 [Black Hearts](/wiki/Health#Black_Hearts "Health") on pickup.


Notes[]
-------


* Does not affect  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper")/ [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper").
* (Removed in Repentance)This item is difficult to use for anyone with red health, as it is impossible to have no red hearts without removing all heart containers (such as through [Devil deals](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room")). It is best used by characters that cannot gain red health at all, such as  [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)").
* (Added in Repentance)Characters can now deplete their red health fully through sources like [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Machines#Blood_Donation_Machine "Machines") while having other hearts like [soul hearts](/wiki/Health#Soul_Hearts "Health"). As a result, this item is usable for a wider amount of characters, and has synergies with characters who prefer to have no red health (such as  [(Eve)](/wiki/Eve "Eve") [Eve](/wiki/Eve "Eve")).


Synergies[]
-----------


* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[(Brittle Bones)](/wiki/Brittle_Bones "Brittle Bones") [Brittle Bones](/wiki/Brittle_Bones "Brittle Bones"): The empty [bone hearts](/wiki/Health#Bone_Hearts "Health") will trigger Empty Vessel.
* [(Gnawed Leaf)](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf") [Gnawed Leaf](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf"): If the player has no Red Hearts, they can stand still and wait for the shield to activate, allowing the player to deal damage without leaving invulnerability.
