Effects
---------


* Gives Isaac [stat](/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") upgrades when he buys items/pickups from [shops](/wiki/Shop "Shop").
	+ The three possible stat upgrades Keeper's Sack can give are +0.5 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage"), +0.03 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed"), and +0.25 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
	+ Keeper's Sack will always give one stat upgrade when Isaac makes a purchase, plus one for every 5 cents Isaac spent on the pickup/item.
* Spawns three [coins](/wiki/Coins "Coins") and a [key](/wiki/Key "Key") on pickup.


Notes
-------


* Keeper's Sack works with anything that costs coins, including [Devil deals](/wiki/Devil_deal "Devil deal")/[Black Markets](/wiki/Black_Market "Black Market") as  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") / affected by [(Keeper's Bargain)](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Bargain "Keeper's Bargain") [Keeper's Bargain](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Bargain "Keeper's Bargain") or [![image](/image/A_Pound_of_Flesh.png)](/wiki/A_Pound_of_Flesh "A Pound of Flesh") [A Pound of Flesh](/wiki/A_Pound_of_Flesh "A Pound of Flesh"), items or pickups created by [![image](/image/Keeper%27s_Box.png)](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Box "Keeper's Box") [Keeper's Box](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Box "Keeper's Box"), the Angel shop created by [![image](/image/The_Stairway.png)](/wiki/The_Stairway "The Stairway") [The Stairway](/wiki/The_Stairway "The Stairway"), and the second shop created by [![image](/image/Member_Card.png)](/wiki/Member_Card "Member Card") [Member Card](/wiki/Member_Card "Member Card").
* All stat upgrades are tied to the item itself; losing Keeper's Sack somehow will result in the loss of all obtained stat upgrades.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Store Credit)](/wiki/Store_Credit "Store Credit") [Store Credit](/wiki/Store_Credit "Store Credit"): Anything bought will not give stats.
* [![image](/image/Steam_Sale.png)](/wiki/Steam_Sale "Steam Sale") [Steam Sale](/wiki/Steam_Sale "Steam Sale"): Stat boosts for every 5 coins spent will only apply to the modified cost after picking up Steam Sale rather than the original cost.
