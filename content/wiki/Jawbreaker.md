 # Jawbreaker ![image](/image/Jawbreaker.png) 

Effects
---------


* Adds a 10% chance to fire teeth that deal 3.2x Isaac's damage; mechanically identical to the passive item [(Tough Love)](/wiki/Tough_Love "Tough Love") [Tough Love](/wiki/Tough_Love "Tough Love").
	+ The chance for this to occur increases with [Luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck"). The activation rate is equal to 1/(10 - Luck). At base Luck (0), the chance is 10%, maxing out at 100% at 9 Luck


Notes
-------


* This trinket is identical in function with [(Tough Love)](/wiki/Tough_Love "Tough Love") [Tough Love](/wiki/Tough_Love "Tough Love"), so all interactions with that item apply to this trinket as well.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Tough Love)](/wiki/Tough_Love "Tough Love") [Tough Love](/wiki/Tough_Love "Tough Love"): Activation rates are individually applied to each tear, effectively allowing for higher amounts of teeth. However at 9 Luck, this trinket is no longer needed, as Tough Love will already guarantee that every shot is a tooth at that point.
