 # Censer ![image](/image/Censer.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") projecting a circular aura that [slows](/wiki/Status_Effects#Effects "Status Effects") enemies and enemy shots within its radius and for some time once they exit.


Notes
-------


* The aura does not affect bosses but slows down their shots.
	+ Bosses that use tight volleys of projectiles are extremely difficult to avoid without additional items to block, remove, or redirect those shots, as the slowing effect will cause their attacks to clump together.


Synergies
-----------

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Bot_Fly.png)](/wiki/Bot_Fly "Bot Fly") [Bot Fly](/wiki/Bot_Fly "Bot Fly")/[![image](/image/Psy_Fly.png)](/wiki/Psy_Fly "Psy Fly") [Psy Fly](/wiki/Psy_Fly "Psy Fly"): The slowing aura allows these items to deal with the incoming projectiles more reliably.
* [![image](/image/The_Soul.png)](/wiki/The_Soul "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul "The Soul"): The slowing aura allows incoming enemies and shots to be more reliably deflected.


Interactions
--------------
