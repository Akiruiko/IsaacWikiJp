Effects[]
---------


* Gives Isaac two [(Key)](/wiki/Key "Key") [Keys](/wiki/Key "Key").
* If a non- [(Red Chest)](/wiki/Red_Chest "Red Chest") [Red Chest](/wiki/Red_Chest "Red Chest") spawns [hearts](/wiki/Hearts "Hearts"), [coins](/wiki/Coins "Coins"), [bombs](/wiki/Bombs "Bombs") and/or [keys](/wiki/Keys "Keys"), causes the chest to spawn a second group of said pickups, effectively doubling the average pickup yield.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Yes Mother?](/wiki/Yes_Mother%3F "Yes Mother?") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into his mother.


Notes[]
-------


* Mom's Key cannot change the contents of a chest; it will only cause it to spawn extra pickups.
* All other chest rewards (such as [pills](/wiki/Pill "Pill"), [cards](/wiki/Card "Card"), [items](/wiki/Item "Item"), etc.) will not cause the chest to spawn additional pickups.
* (Added in Repentance) Does not affect [(Old Chest)](/wiki/Old_Chest "Old Chest") [Old Chests](/wiki/Old_Chest "Old Chest").


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Mom's Key)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Key "Mom's Key") Mom's Key: Does not further increase the amount of pickups spawned when multiple copies of the item are acquired.
