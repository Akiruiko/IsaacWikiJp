Effects
---------


* Converts all enemy Dips into Dip familiars.
* Rocks have a chance to be replaced with poop when generated.
* Destroying [poops](/wiki/Poops "Poops") spawn 1-4 [Dip Familiars](/wiki/Familiar#Dips "Familiar"), which loosely follow Isaac around, block enemy shots, and deal contact damage to enemies.
	+ Dips deal contact damage to enemies equal to the [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") Isaac had at the time it spawned, and can deal up to 2 ticks of contact damage and/or block 2 shots before dying.
* Destroying different types of poop will spawn special Dips:
	+ Corn Poops create Corny Dips that spawn 1 [Blue Fly](/wiki/Blue_Fly "Blue Fly") on death.
		- Brownie Dips spawned by [Brownie](/wiki/Brownie "Brownie") and [Dangle](/wiki/Dangle "Dangle") have the same behavior.
	+ Red Poops create Red Dips that deal twice as much damage and autonomously charge at enemies, but automatically die after 15 seconds.
	+ Golden Poops create Gold Dips that have a chance to inflict the [![image](/image/Midas%27_Touch.png)](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") [Midas' Touch](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") effect on enemies they hit. They can also take 5 hits before being destroyed.
	+ Rainbow Poops create Rainbow Dips that [charm](/wiki/Charm "Charm") enemies they hit and have a chance to drop a half [red heart](/wiki/Red_heart "Red heart") on death.
	+ Black Poops create Black Dips that leave a trail of [slowing](/wiki/Slow "Slow") [creep](/wiki/Creep "Creep").
	+ White Poops create White Dips that recreate the effect of [![image](/image/Hallowed_Ground.png)](/wiki/Hallowed_Ground "Hallowed Ground") [Hallowed Ground](/wiki/Hallowed_Ground "Hallowed Ground") and can take 3 hits before being destroyed.
* Poops unique to  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") and [![image](/image/IBS.png)](/wiki/IBS "IBS") [IBS](/wiki/IBS "IBS") also spawn Dips with special effects:
	+ Stone Poops create Rock Dips that deal an additional 3.5 damage per hit and can take 6 hits before dying instead of 2.
	+ Stinky Poops create Stinky Dips that release toxic gas as they move and a larger cloud of toxic gas when they die.
		- The toxic gas does 0.5x Isaac's damage per tick (~1.2x Isaac's damage per second) and [poisons](/wiki/Poison "Poison") enemies; clouds left behind while alive last 1.5 seconds and the cloud created on death lasts 8 seconds.
	+ Fire Poops create Flaming Dips that [burn](/wiki/Status_Effects#Burn "Status Effects") enemies they hit and leave behind a fire when they die.
		- The burn deals 3.5 damage up to 6 times, and the fire deals 8 damage at full durability, 6 after taking 1 hit, and 4 otherwise, for a maximum of 22 damage.
* This item belongs to the [Oh Crap](/wiki/Oh_Crap "Oh Crap") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a walking pile of poop.
