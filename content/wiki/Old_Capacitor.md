 # Old Capacitor ![image](/image/Old_Capacitor.png) 

Effects
---------


* Active items don't charge when clearing rooms. Adds a ({\displaystyle \min(1/5+0.03*{\mathit {Luck}},1/3)}) chance to spawn a [Lil' Battery](/wiki/Lil%27_Battery "Lil' Battery") when clearing a room, independent of the room's original drop.


Synergies
-----------


* [(4.5 Volt)](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") [4.5 Volt](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt"): Since the 4.5 Volt also makes it so that active items don't charge when clearing rooms, this trinket can be picked up with no downside.
* [![image](/image/Dim_Bulb.png)](/wiki/Dim_Bulb "Dim Bulb") [Dim Bulb](/wiki/Dim_Bulb "Dim Bulb") + [(Mom's Purse)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Purse "Mom's Purse") [Mom's Purse](/wiki/Mom%27s_Purse "Mom's Purse") / [(Smelter)](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") / "Gulp!" pill: Since items do not automatically recharge upon being used, being able to hold both Old Capacitor and Dim Bulb together will allow the latter's effects to be constantly active, while the batteries allow control over when exactly to charge active items.
