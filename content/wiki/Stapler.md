 # Stapler ![image](/image/Stapler.png) 


Effects
---------


* Isaac fires tears from both eyes at the same time.
* Isaac's tears are fired diagonally outwards, similar to the effect of the [R U a Wizard?](/wiki/R_U_a_Wizard%3F "R U a Wizard?") pill.
* Isaac's tears become [spectral](/wiki/Tear_Effects "Tear Effects").


Notes
-------


* The maximum amount of tears per volley that can be reached by combining and/or duplicating [![image](/image/20/20.png)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20"), [![image](/image/The_Inner_Eye.png)](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") [The Inner Eye](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye"), [![image](/image/Mutant_Spider.png)](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") [Mutant Spider](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") and The Wiz is 16, or 20 with  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Diplopia.png)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia"): Picking up a second The Wiz will make Isaac fire 4 tears in a wider diagonal layout.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Picking up a second The Wiz will make Isaac fire 1 additional tear in front of him, giving the same effect as the [Conjoined](/wiki/Conjoined "Conjoined") transformation.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Eye_of_the_Occult.png)](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult") [Eye of the Occult](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult"): Both tears shoot much closer together and can be controlled, creating for a better double shot similar to what Tractor Beam would grant.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Technology_Zero.png)](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero") [Technology Zero](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero"): Electricity arcs between both tears instantly, providing incredible crowd control.
	+ **Technology Zero** + [Piercing](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears"): Tears cannot be stopped by enemies, resulting in an unstoppable array of electricity between tears.
* [![image](/image/Tractor_Beam.png)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): Both tears will follow the beam, making it easier to hit enemies with them, effectively like [![image](/image/20/20.png)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") with Spectral tears.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The Wiz is superior to 20/20 with Tractor Beam, due to having no damage penalty.
	+ **Tractor Beam** + [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Both knives ignore the path of the beam and remain flying diagonally.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Analog_Stick.png)](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick") [Analog Stick](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick"): Will make one tear go forwards and the other tear fire at a 90-degree angle to the other tear.
* [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel"): Azazel fires two short diagonal [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") beams in the chosen direction (Same with  [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel")).
* [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") beams remain diagonal even if Isaac has [![image](/image/Tractor_Beam.png)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam").
	+ [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") + [![image](/image/Anti-Gravity.png)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): Overrides The Wiz.
* [(Cain)](/wiki/Cain "Cain") [Cain](/wiki/Cain "Cain"): Makes Cain fire in the two diagonal directions instead of just his right eye as the [R U a Wizard?](/wiki/R_U_a_Wizard%3F "R U a Wizard?") pill does.
* [Conjoined](/wiki/Conjoined "Conjoined"): Fires double tears in both directions, but removes the center tear.
* [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): The crosshair is controlled diagonally as if rotated 45 degrees clockwise from usual (i.e.: the up arrow will move it in a northeast direction), and two missiles are fired, similar to the effect of [![image](/image/20/20.png)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20"). The crosshair can be moved in the cardinal directions by pressing two arrow keys at once (e.g.: pressing the up and right arrows will move the crosshair right).
* [Homing tears](/wiki/Homing_tears "Homing tears"): Tears are more likely to home in on enemies if enemies are coming towards Isaac diagonally. Otherwise, it only minorly improves accuracy.
* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Small tear orbits the main tear. Tear controls rotated 45 degrees clockwise - holding up makes it move northeast and so on.
* [![image](/image/Marked.png)](/wiki/Marked "Marked") [Marked](/wiki/Marked "Marked"): Fires two shots aimed diagonally from the crosshair.
* [![image](/image/Monstro%27s_Lung.png)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"): 7-8 tears are fired at each diagonal direction instead of a full burst.
* [R U a Wizard?](/wiki/R_U_a_Wizard%3F "R U a Wizard?") pill: Makes Isaac fire forward with a normal fire rate and 90 degrees outwards with half fire rate.
* [![image](/image/Sad_Bombs.png)](/wiki/Sad_Bombs "Sad Bombs") [Sad Bombs](/wiki/Sad_Bombs "Sad Bombs"): Does not affect the number of tears when bombs explode.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Varicose_Veins.png)](/wiki/Varicose_Veins "Varicose Veins") [Varicose Veins](/wiki/Varicose_Veins "Varicose Veins"): No effect on number of tears when taking damage.
