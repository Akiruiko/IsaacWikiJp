Effects[]
---------


* Double tapping a direction makes Isaac quickly dash in that direction.
	+ Isaac is immune to damage from all sources during the dash, with the exception of [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Machines#Blood_Donation_Machine "Machines"), [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_Beggar "Devil Beggar"), and similar self-damage active items.
	+ The dash deals damage equal to 4x Isaac's damage + 8.
	+ The direction of the dash can be changed by holding another button.
	+ The dash has an approximate 3 second cooldown.


Notes[]
-------


* The dash can be used to enter [curse rooms](/wiki/Curse_room "Curse room") and open [spiked chests](/wiki/Chests#Spiked_Chest "Chests")/[mimic chests](/wiki/Chest#Mimic_Chest "Chest") without taking damage.
* The dash can destroy [Shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper").
* With a controller, tapping the joystick is rather inconsistent, and the dash can often activate by accident. Using the directional pad instead is recommended.
* When Mars's dash is charged, Isaac will occasionally flash brightly, and visible steam will emit from his nose.
* Extra care needs to be taken with this item, as tapping for precise movements too quickly will cause a dash.
