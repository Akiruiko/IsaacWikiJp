Notes[]
-------


* Black Hearts give the same stat boosts as normal soul hearts.
* Soul Locket only activates when picking up actual Soul Hearts, not if they're directly added to Isaac's [health](/wiki/Health "Health") (such as by a [Balls of Steel pill](/wiki/Pills "Pills") or [(Book of Revelations)](/wiki/Book_of_Revelations "Book of Revelations") [Book of Revelations](/wiki/Book_of_Revelations "Book of Revelations")).
* This item gives stats when adding to  [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany")'s soul charges.
* This item is useless for  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper"), since he cannot encounter soul hearts.
* Hearts acquired prior to picking up Soul Locket will not provide stat boosts.
* If Soul Locket is removed (such as with  [(Tainted Isaac)](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac")), stat boosts will not be removed.
