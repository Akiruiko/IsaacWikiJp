 # Transcendence ![image](/image/Transcendence.png) 


Effects
---------


* Shoots 10 tears in a circle around Isaac.
* The tears retain the [Shot Speed](/wiki/Shot_Speed "Shot Speed") and special [effects](/wiki/Effects "Effects") (such as [poison](/wiki/Effects#Poison "Effects")) of Isaac's tears.
* Each tear will do Isaac's current damage and a flat +25 damage bonus on top.


Synergies

* [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") / [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Isaac will fire Brimstone lasers in all directions. (Removed in Repentance) Each laser is given bonus damage.

The wisps' tears deal 1.5 damage, but fire twice as fast as standard wisps. Tears are inaccurate and fire in a spread.

* [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): The size and damage of tears shot depends on how far Chocolate Milk is charged.
* [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel"): Although Tainted Azazel's Brimstone beams do not have a damage bonus, they also do not have the normal damage penalty and still deal double damage to enemies that have been sneezed on.


Interactions

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Eye_of_the_Occult.png)](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult") [Eye of the Occult](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult"): The tears quickly lose their outward momentum and can now be controlled all at once, making it easy to make the tears hit enemies.
