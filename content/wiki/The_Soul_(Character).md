Pressing the swap key (CTRL on PC / R2 on PS4 / RT on Xbox / ZR on Switch) will switch control to **The Soul**, a blue ghost chained to The Forgotten who fires spectral tears and can fly. 

While controlling The Soul, The Forgotten cannot take damage, blocks all normal shots that touch it, and attracts shots in a small <1 tile radius. If The Soul dies, the run will end.


概要
-------


ノート
-------

* The Forgotten's bone club deals 3× his damage when swung and 1.5× his damage when thrown. The melee attack deals knockback to enemies ((Added in Repentance)and occasionally The Forgotten himself) if it hits.
	+ (Added in Repentance) At 22.50 [fire rate](/wiki/Tears "Tears") or above, he can no longer throw the bone club, and at 30.00 or above, the melee attack is automatically performed while holding shoot key.
* The Forgotten's bone club passes through walls, obstacles, and enemies. Thrown bone club can hit an enemy up to twice (once on lauching path and once on returning path).
* The Forgotten cannot take [deals with the Devil](/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil "Deal with the Devil") as he only has bone hearts, but The Soul can with its soul hearts. If a deal would kill The Soul, quickly switching to The Forgotten will keep him alive.
	+ If The Soul has no Hearts, switching to The Soul is disabled until another Soul or Black Heart is acquired.
	+ Losing red hearts inside bone heart containers does not count as red heart damage for devil deal chances, but breaking bone heart containers does. (This includes breaking them through self-damaging items, Curse Room usage, Sacrifice Rooms, Devil Beggars, Blood Donation Machines, etc.)
	+ (Added in Repentance) The Forgotten can take devil deals at the cost of Bone Hearts, equally to normal Red Hearts.
		- (Added in Repentance) As such, it is possible to softlock the game by taking a deal that would kill The Forgotten and switching to The Soul.
			* (Added in Repentance) It may be possible to avoid this softlock with (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright"), since going through doorways as The Soul doesn't reset control to The Forgotten.
* The Forgotten's melee attack can collect pickups and open chests.
	+ Opening a [Mimic Chest](/wiki/Mimic_Chest "Mimic Chest") this way deals no damage.
	+ [Bomb Chests](/wiki/Chests#Stone_Chest "Chests") cannot be opened this way. [Locked Chests](/wiki/Locked_Chest "Locked Chest") and [Eternal Chests](/wiki/Eternal_Chest "Eternal Chest") still require a key or the [(Paper Clip)](/wiki/Paper_Clip "Paper Clip") [Paper Clip](/wiki/Paper_Clip "Paper Clip") to open.
	+ Items that can be moved but cannot be picked up are pushed. This can launch [bombs](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb") [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus")-style or knock [Troll Bombs](/wiki/Troll_Bomb "Troll Bomb") away.
* The Forgotten has a higher chance of finding Bone Hearts compared to other characters.
* [(Crow Heart)](/wiki/Crow_Heart "Crow Heart") [Crow Heart](/wiki/Crow_Heart "Crow Heart") prevents The Forgotten from losing bone heart containers as long as it still has red health.
* The [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed") and [tear height](/wiki/Tear_height "Tear height") stats have no effect on The Forgotten's melee attack or bone toss.
* The [range](/wiki/Range "Range") stat increases how far away from The Forgotten the melee attack's arcs appear. It doesn't affect the bone toss.
* The range of the melee attack scales with character size, but if character size is smaller than initial size, the melee attack range does not become smaller than initial.
* To switch between two pills/cards, press the swap key twice quickly.
* Picking up health upgrades as The Soul will convert them into soul hearts, just like  [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)"). It's generally advisable to pick up health as The Forgotten, since bone hearts are much rarer.
* (Removed in Repentance)Unidentified pills are more safely consumed in Soul form, as a [Hematemesis](/wiki/Hematemesis "Hematemesis") pill can be very detrimental for The Forgotten but has no negative effect when consumed as The Soul.
	+ [Health Down](/wiki/Health_Down "Health Down") pills are converted to [Health Up](/wiki/Health_Up "Health Up") for both forms, but the empty bone heart gained may be risky for retaining Devil Room chances.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Health Down pills aren't converted to Health Up anymore.
* (Added in Repentance) With (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright"), the player can leave The Forgotten's body in a room and move to a different room with The Soul. When the player switches control back to The Forgotten, The Soul instantly teleports back to the other room where the body was left in.
	+ (Added in Repentance) This makes it possible to enter and leave [Curse Rooms](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") entirely without taking damage - leave the body outside of the Curse Room, go into the Curse Room as The Soul, then switch control to leave.
	+ (Added in Repentance) This behavior can possibly complicate things at the [Rotgut](/wiki/Rotgut "Rotgut") fight - after the player defeats the third phase of the boss as The Soul and is ejected back into the boss room, switching control back to The Forgotten will teleport the player back into the third phase of the fight, with that phase of the boss having respawned.
* In Co-Op mode, if The Forgotten dies, their ghost baby will wield the bone club instead of firing tears.


Unlocking The Forgotten
-------------------------


[The Lamb](/wiki/The_Lamb "The Lamb") must have been defeated previously before The Forgotten can be unlocked, and unlocking The Forgotten can be done in both Normal and Hard difficulty. Having [![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") unlocked is recommended.


(Added in Repentance) Step 1 and Step 2 can be circumvented entirely if you use (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spindown_Dice.png)](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") [Spindown Dice](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") on (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Mucormycosis.png)](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis") [Mucormycosis](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis"), as it will reroll into the completed Shovel.



1. First, start a new unseeded run as any character. Defeat the first floor's boss within 1 minute. If done correctly, Mom will yell and the sound of running footsteps will play, then a large shadow of a shovel handle will loom over the floor of the starting room. Bombing anywhere in the starting room will spawn the [![image](/image/Broken_Shovel.png)](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel") [Broken Shovel](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel"). Initially the shovel piece behaves like a pickup, laying on the floor, and turns into an active collectible only when touched for the first time.
	* Holding the Broken Shovel will cause Mom to continually try to stomp Isaac. Using the Broken Shovel will stop the stomping for the current room, or the current wave of a multi-wave room such as the Boss Rush.
		+ The stomps won't happen in the [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom") fight.
		+ (Removed in Repentance) Stomps count as explosions, so [![image](/image/Pyromaniac.png)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") or [![image](/image/Host_Hat.png)](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") [Host Hat](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") provide immunity to them.
		+ Stomps break rocks and damage enemies. If the player has [![image](/image/Gnawed_Leaf.png)](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf") [Gnawed Leaf](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf") and a lot of patience, the stomps will eventually clear most rooms.
		+ Stomps will open secret rooms.
	* On XL floors, only the last boss must be defeated. [The Emperor](/wiki/The_Emperor "The Emperor") Card allows the first boss to be skipped.
	* Once the Broken Shovel is picked up, it ***must not*** be replaced by another active item. If it is on an item pedestal when Isaac leaves the room, it will disappear.
		+ If Isaac has [![image](/image/Schoolbag.png)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"), another active item can still be carried safely.
			- (Added in Repentance)Mom still stomps if the Broken Shovel is carried in either Schoolbag slot.
	* If playing in Co-op, Mom will only target the player with the Broken Shovel. If this character dies, the stomps will stop, and if they are resurrected, the stomps continue. If you beat Mom while the character holding the Broken Shovel is dead, the Boss Rush door is closed and the Womb entrance is sealed. If you have a card/pill/item that allows for teleportation, returning to Boss Room fixes this bug.
	* (Added in Repentance) [![image](/image/Mama_Mega!.png)](/wiki/Mama_Mega! "Mama Mega!") [Mama Mega!](/wiki/Mama_Mega! "Mama Mega!") can also be used to spawn the [![image](/image/Broken_Shovel.png)](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel") [Broken Shovel](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel").
2. Next, clear [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush"). This will grant the second piece of the [![image](/image/Broken_Shovel.png)](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel") [Broken Shovel](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel"), completing [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Shovel.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Shovel "Mom's Shovel") [Mom's Shovel](/wiki/Mom%27s_Shovel "Mom's Shovel").
	* You should be careful if you're playing as [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac"). due to the fact that the 2nd piece of the broken shovel will be shifting between the shovel piece and a random item.
	* The Broken Shovel ***must*** be held when the boss rush is beaten. Otherwise, only a normal boss rush completion item will drop.
	* After defeating [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom"), if it is unlocked, only[![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") will spawn, otherwise a standard boss item will spawn.
	* If [![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") is not unlocked you must use a [Sacrifice Room](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room") to proceed to [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room"), ***you are not guaranteed to be able to do this on every run.***
	* The normal 20-minute time limit to reach Boss Rush does not apply. The hole to [(Womb)](/wiki/Womb "Womb") [Womb](/wiki/Womb "Womb") after [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom") will be sealed until the Boss Rush is completed.
	* After Mom's Shovel is acquired, Mom's feet will stop attempting to stomp Isaac.
3. Finally, a single [Grave Room](/wiki/Grave_Room "Grave Room") with a [dirt patch](/wiki/Dirt_patch "Dirt patch") in its center will appear in the [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room"). Using Mom's Shovel while standing on the dirt patch unlocks The Forgotten.
	* If the Grave Room is exited before the soul reaches the top of the screen, The Forgotten may not unlock.
	* Holding Mom's Shovel prevents the beam of light to the Cathedral from appearing, forcing Isaac into the trapdoor to [(Sheol)](/wiki/Sheol "Sheol") [Sheol](/wiki/Sheol "Sheol").
	* If stuck, confused, or frustrated, check the[![image](/image/Broken_Shovel.png)](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel") [Broken Shovel](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel") page for tips and help.


アイテム効果
-------------------



Many items have unique interactions with The Forgotten's bone club or The Soul and The Forgotten's unique health system. The Soul's tears are affected normally.



* [![image](/image/Abaddon.png)](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") [Abaddon](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon"): Grants 2 black hearts to The Soul and empties The Forgotten's bone hearts, but doesn't remove them.
* [![image](/image/Adrenaline.png)](/wiki/Adrenaline "Adrenaline") [Adrenaline](/wiki/Adrenaline "Adrenaline"): Empty bone hearts increase damage, but the damage buff is removed if the bone heart breaks.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Almond_Milk.png)](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk") [Almond Milk](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk"): Holding shoot key makes The Forgotten constantly perform his melee attack and releasing the key makes him throw his bone club.

The bone club will quadruple when passing through prism whether traveling away from or back towards The Forgotten.

* [![image](/image/Converter.png)](/wiki/Converter "Converter") [Converter](/wiki/Converter "Converter"): Takes (Removed in Repentance)two or (Added in Repentance)one soul or black hearts and gives a bone heart if used in Soul form.

* [![image](/image/Cursed_Eye.png)](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") [Cursed Eye](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye"): The Forgotten's bone toss attack is replaced with multiple rapid melee attacks, the number depending on how long the attack buttons are held.
* [![image](/image/Dark_Bum.png)](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum") [Dark Bum](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum"): Makes it harder to keep The Forgotten's bone heart containers, since every red hearts on the floor will be collected and transformed into soul hearts, which can only be used by The Soul.

* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Lead_Pencil.png)](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil") [Lead Pencil](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil"): No effect on The Forgotten's bone club.

* [![image](/image/Libra.png)](/wiki/Libra "Libra") [Libra](/wiki/Libra "Libra"): Barring combinations with other items, The Forgotten's heavy attack rate penalty is mitigated but all other stats consequently become lower.
