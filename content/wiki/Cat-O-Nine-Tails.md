 # Cat-O-Nine-Tails ![image](/image/Cat-O-Nine-Tails.png) 


Effect
--------


* Spawns a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") which follows Isaac and picks up any nearby [coins](/wiki/Coins "Coins"). Bumbo changes level based on the amount of coins it's collected.


(Collectible Bumbo level 1.png) **Level 1 (0-5 coins):** Bumbo just collects coins to level up.
(Collectible Bumbo level 2.png) **Level 2 (6-11 coins):** Bumbo occasionally drops a [pickup](/wiki/Pickup "Pickup"), [trinket](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket"), [chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest") or pedestal item after a room clear.
(Collectible Bumbo level 3.png) **Level 3 (12-23 coins):** Bumbo now fires tears that deal 3.5 damage in the same direction Isaac does. Bumbo's tears have a chance to drop a coin if they hit an enemy.
(Collectible Bumbo level 4.png) **Level 4 (24+ coins):** Bumbo no longer fires tears and instead chases enemies slowly and deals contact damage (2.5 per tick, or 37.5 per second). Bumbo will occasionally drop [bombs](/wiki/Bombs "Bombs") while chasing enemies or coins.
* After reaching level 4, Bumbo will continue to collect coins, and can drop a pickup, trinket, or chest for each coin it collects, similar to [![image](/image/Bum_Friend.png)](/wiki/Bum_Friend "Bum Friend") [Bum Friend](/wiki/Bum_Friend "Bum Friend"). However, unlike Bum Friend, Bumbo can also drop pedestal items.


Notes
-------


* Level 1-3 Bumbo can fly over pits and [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles"), despite having limbs at level 2 and 3 that serve him as legs.
* If Bumbo consumes an absurd amount of coins while level four, Bumbo can become level one again [Unsure if bug]
* If Level 4 Bumbo targets [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan")'s head, Bumbo will attempt to "chase" him the entire fight by standing in the middle of the room.
* Level 4 Bumbo's bombs are unaffected by Isaac's bomb synergies.
* Bumbo cannot pick up [Sticky Nickels](/wiki/Sticky_Nickel "Sticky Nickel") and will hover over them. Level 4 Bumbo can eventually bomb the Sticky Nickel to free it.
* Bumbo will pick up [Lucky Pennies](/wiki/Lucky_Penny "Lucky Penny"), without additional benefit to evolution or drops.
* If Bumbo drops a pedestal item, it will be pulled from a random [item pool](/wiki/Item_Pool "Item Pool").
* Bumbo will not evolve if he takes coins from exploding the Donation Machine.
* In a [RERUN](/wiki/RERUN "RERUN"), Bumbo's level is reset.
* Level 4 Bumbo can target charmed enemies and will try to follow them around to no effect. This prevents him from picking up coins until the target is changed.
* (Added in Repentance) There is a similar [boss](/wiki/Boss "Boss") named [Bumbino](/wiki/Bumbino "Bumbino").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Doubles both the contact and shot damage, when applicable.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Box_of_Friends.png)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends"): Will spawn a level 1 Bumbo regardless of the original Bumbo's current level.
* [![image](/image/Bum_Friend.png)](/wiki/Bum_Friend "Bum Friend") [Bum Friend](/wiki/Bum_Friend "Bum Friend"): The bum friend will follow Bumbo instead of Isaac.
* [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper"): Not recommended, as the coins Bumbo collects could have been used to heal Keeper.
* (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"): Due to the large influx of coins spawned, it's technically possible to sustain Bumbo while also maintaining a good level of wealth and health.


Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | (Added in Repentance) Bumbo's level can be reset after the sequence of obtaining [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") in [(Ashpit)](/wiki/Ashpit "Ashpit") [Ashpit](/wiki/Ashpit "Ashpit")/[(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines") II. |
