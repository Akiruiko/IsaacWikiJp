 # Azazel's Stump ![image](/image/Azazel%27s_Stump.png) 

Effects
---------


* Gives Isaac a chance to visually turn into  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") when clearing a room. Isaac keeps his hearts and items, but changes his tears to be a short range [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"), grants a x1.5 damage multiplier and gains the ability to [fly](/wiki/Flight "Flight").
	+ The effect lasts until clearing and leaving another room.
	+ The effect can be taken to the next floor.


Notes
-------


* Dropping the trinket after this transformation will not reverse it, until a new room is cleared.
* While having this trinket as Azazel, the effect changes to make his short Brimstone much wider. This is akin to the [(Birthright)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") effect.
* The trinket only changes the player's appearance to be as Azazel's but doesn't change the actual player type. This means that the trinket cannot be used to unlock [achievements](/wiki/Achievements "Achievements") for Azazel.
* The effect will not change the player's health mechanics. For example,  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") will retain his zero health and [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle").
