Effects[]
---------


* Spawns two demon [familiars](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that float by Isaac's side, and fire tears that use Isaac's [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears"), [range](/wiki/Range "Range"), [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed"), and [tear effects](/wiki/Tear_effects "Tear effects"), and scale with Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
	+ Each familiar deals damage equal to 0.375x Isaac's damage.
* This item belongs to the [Conjoined](/wiki/Conjoined "Conjoined") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a three-faced version of himself.


Notes[]
-------


* Twisted Pair is very similar to the item [(Incubus)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus"). It provides the same total damage per second increase in the form of a familiar (familiars in this case).
* When playing as  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith"), the demon familiars will not inherit Lilith's damage stats as Incubus does.
* Holding the up/down + left/right attack buttons will make one demon go further behind and the other one in front of Isaac.
* Because the demons need time to adjust their position while firing, the left\right directional buttons can be tapped to shoot more precise, straight lines of tears.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Box of Friends)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends")/[(Crooked Penny)](/wiki/Crooked_Penny "Crooked Penny") [Crooked Penny](/wiki/Crooked_Penny "Crooked Penny")/[(Diplopia)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia"): Each additional Twisted Pair will add two more familiars that float farther out from Isaac.
* [(Tractor Beam)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): Twisted Pair's tears follow the beam.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Epic Fetus)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Each familiar will fire a missile from a two additional crosshairs. **Not Recommended**, as the twisted pair crosshairs are not synced to Isaac's crosshair and move at a much slower rate, making self damage much more likely as the additional crosshairs will struggle to make distance from Isaac.
* [(Eye of Greed)](/wiki/Eye_of_Greed "Eye of Greed") [Eye of Greed](/wiki/Eye_of_Greed "Eye of Greed") When the tear effect triggers, it occurs 3 times and costs you 3 coins.
* [(Found Soul)](/wiki/Found_Soul "Found Soul") [Found Soul](/wiki/Found_Soul "Found Soul"): While the soul is alive, decreases Twisted Pair's damage by 20%.
* [(Sacrificial Altar)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar") [Sacrificial Altar](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar"): Only 1 item pedestal is spawned for their sacrifice, unless they were spawned through [(Cambion Conception)](/wiki/Cambion_Conception "Cambion Conception") [Cambion Conception](/wiki/Cambion_Conception "Cambion Conception"), in which case they will count for two.
