 # Hungry Soul ![image](/image/Hungry_Soul.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants enemies a chance to spawn a friendly ghost upon death, which rapidly chases down and deals contact damage to enemies.
	+ The chance to spawn a ghost is 33% and is not affected by [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").
	+ Ghosts deal contact damage equal to half of Isaac's damage, 4 times per second (2x Isaac's damage per second).
* After 7 seconds, the ghost explodes, dealing 7 flat damage to nearby enemies up to 3-4 times.
	+ The explosion cannot damage Isaac or the environment.


Notes
-------


* Enemies killed by ghosts are unable to spawn more ghosts, except for those killed by the ghost's final explosion.
* The ghost's explosion is capable of damaging [friendly](/wiki/Friendly "Friendly") monsters, such as [Bonies](/wiki/Bony "Bony") summoned by [![image](/image/Book_of_the_Dead.png)](/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead "Book of the Dead") [Book of the Dead](/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead "Book of the Dead").
* Ghosts cannot be taken outside the room they spawned in.
* The ghosts are not considered to be [familiars](/wiki/Familiars "Familiars") and as such aren't affected by any items that modify the behavior of familiars.
	+ This also means that Isaac can have more than 64 ghosts at a time and this won't override other familiars.
