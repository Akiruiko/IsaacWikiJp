 # The Book of Belial ![image](/image/The_Book_of_Belial.png) 


Effects
---------


* Killing an enemy adds a fly to the jar, up to a maximum of 20.
* Upon use, releases [Blue Flies](/wiki/Blue_Fly "Blue Fly") equal to the number of flies in the jar.
* This item belongs to the [Beelzebub](/wiki/Beelzebub "Beelzebub") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a giant humanoid fly.


Notes
-------


* Kills by blue flies and locusts (including flies from the jar) and shooting familiars (including [![image](/image/Incubus.png)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") and the launch attack from (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Lilith)](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith") [Tainted Lilith](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith")'s fetus) do not add flies to the jar.
* Blue spiders, orbital familiars, and chasing familiars do add flies to the jar.
* Friendly enemies such as from the [![image](/image/Friendly_Ball.png)](/wiki/Friendly_Ball "Friendly Ball") [Friendly Ball](/wiki/Friendly_Ball "Friendly Ball") add flies to the jar, but not those spawned from other enemies.
* Batteries do not affect the number of flies in the jar.
* Enemies must be actually *killed* to add a fly; transformations (such as [Gapers](/wiki/Gaper "Gaper") turning into [Pacers](/wiki/Pacer "Pacer")) or knockouts (such as incapacitating a [Globin](/wiki/Globin "Globin")) do not count as kills.
* Destroying a [shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper") will count as a kill.
* With items that kill normally unkillable enemies, killing things like Stone Grimaces will add flies to the jar.
* Killing minions in the Hush fight does not add flies to the jar.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Using Jar of Flies summons wisps instead of [Blue Flies](/wiki/Familiar#Blue_Flies "Familiar"); the wisps do not summon the flies when destroyed. Up to five flies at a time are consumed to summon one wisp, with stacking health and damage. The damage of the wisps decreases as they take damage. Enemies killed by wisps’ tears will not add flies to the jar.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Fish Tail)](/wiki/Fish_Tail "Fish Tail") [Fish Tail](/wiki/Fish_Tail "Fish Tail"): Doubles the number of flies that spawn.
* [![image](/image/Hive_Mind.png)](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind") [Hive Mind](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind"): Flies are bigger and deal double damage.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Schoolbag.png)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"): Flies will be gained even while the Jar of Flies is in the inactive slot.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): No effect.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Uranus.png)](/wiki/Uranus "Uranus") [Uranus](/wiki/Uranus "Uranus"): Enemies frozen by Uranus do not grant extra flies, even if shattered. Only enemies killed with bombs will add flies.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): Flies will not collect when absorbed by Void, making the interaction worthless.
