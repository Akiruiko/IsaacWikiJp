 # Mine Crafter ![image](/image/Mine_Crafter.png) 


Effect
--------


* Upon use, creates an explosion in the same place as Isaac, damaging him for half a heart of [health](/wiki/Health "Health") and dealing damage to all enemies caught in the blast.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The explosion deals 40 damage.
		- (Added in Repentance) Kamikaze!'s effect is identical to that of [![image](/image/Mr._Mega.png)](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") [Mr. Mega](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") or [![image](/image/Mr._Boom.png)](/wiki/Mr._Boom "Mr. Boom") [Mr. Boom](/wiki/Mr._Boom "Mr. Boom"), dealing 185 damage in a wide radius.


Notes
-------


* Unlike [![image](/image/IV_Bag.png)](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") [IV Bag](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag"), Isaac will not take damage from using Kamikaze while he has any form of invincibility active, such as after being hit.
	+ However, it has a cooldown that lasts as long as the invincibility gained from its own damage, preventing Isaac from using it a second time for the cost of one hit.
* Benefits from many bomb-enhancing items such as [![image](/image/Bob%27s_Curse.png)](/wiki/Bob%27s_Curse "Bob's Curse") [Bob's Curse](/wiki/Bob%27s_Curse "Bob's Curse"), with exceptions listed below.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Blind Rage)](/wiki/Blind_Rage "Blind Rage") [Blind Rage](/wiki/Blind_Rage "Blind Rage"): With longer invincibility, Isaac can use Kamikaze! a second time without taking damage.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns wisps in the middle ring, looking like small sticks of dynamite. The wisps fire explosive projectiles and explode when destroyed, dealing 30 damage to enemies that are close to it. This explosion is small enough to not hit Isaac, although it will hurt him should he get caught in it. All explosions the wisps make are unaffected by [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") and bomb synergies.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Dark_Arts.png)](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts") [Dark Arts](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts"): Kamikaze can be used for free while Dark Arts is active.
* [![image](/image/Gnawed_Leaf.png)](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf") [Gnawed Leaf](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf"): Activating Kamikaze will cancel out of the statue state, but Isaac will not be damaged by the resulting explosion, unlike with other self-damage activated items.
* [![image](/image/Holy_Mantle.png)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle"): The mantle will absorb the damage from the explosion if it is the first damage in the room. It can be used repeatedly by re-entering the same room after each use.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Host_Hat.png)](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") [Host Hat](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") / [![image](/image/Pyromaniac.png)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac"): Allows unlimited uses without consequences.
	+ [![image](/image/Pyromaniac.png)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac"): Each use will heal Isaac for one red heart.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Mars.png)](/wiki/Mars "Mars") [Mars](/wiki/Mars "Mars"): Isaac is invincible during the dash, allowing for unlimited uses with careful timing.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Panic Button)](/wiki/Panic_Button "Panic Button") [Panic Button](/wiki/Panic_Button "Panic Button"): Isaac will use Kamikaze before taking damage, similarly to (Added in Repentance)[(Swallowed M80)](/wiki/Swallowed_M80 "Swallowed M80") [Swallowed M80](/wiki/Swallowed_M80 "Swallowed M80"), with the exception that, if Kamikaze triggers on red health, it will not affect devil/angel deal chances, effectively preserving it.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Schoolbag.png)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"): The cooldown before the player can use Kamikaze! again is eliminated when switching items. Depending on how fast the player can push the buttons, Kamikaze! can be used multiple times during Isaac's invincibility frames.
* (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"): Explodes on Tainted Forgotten’s body, meaning that it is safe to use infinitely so long as Tainted Soul is not within the blast radius.
