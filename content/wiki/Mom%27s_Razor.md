 # Mom's Razor ![image](/image/Mom%27s_Razor.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants a razor familiar that [orbits](/wiki/Familiar#Orbital_Familiars "Familiar") Isaac. Enemies that touch the razor take damage equal to 20% of Isaac's tear damage per tick or 300% of Isaac's damage per second ((Added in Repentance) 200% of Isaac's damage per second) and start to [bleed](/wiki/Bleed "Bleed").
	+ Bosses cannot bleed and won't take any damage from the razor.
	+ Bleeding enemies take damage equal to 10% of their maximum health every 5 seconds.
	+ The razor does not block enemy shots.
* This item belongs to the [Yes Mother?](/wiki/Yes_Mother%3F "Yes Mother?") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into his mother.


Notes
-------


* It may not always be a good idea to take Mom's Razor if Isaac has one or more [Pretty Flies](/wiki/Familiar#Pretty_Fly "Familiar") as orbitals, as Mom's Razor can override Pretty Flies without giving protection from enemy shots.


Synergies
