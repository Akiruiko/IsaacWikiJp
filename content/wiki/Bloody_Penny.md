-------


* (Added in Afterbirth) It can be found by destroying [Special Shopkeepers](/wiki/Special_Shopkeeper "Special Shopkeeper").
* (Added in Afterbirth) This trinket is very useful in [Greed mode](/wiki/Greed_mode "Greed mode"), as the coins dropped for completing a wave now provide health.
* (Added in Afterbirth â€ ) Makes the [Ultra Greedier](/wiki/Ultra_Greedier "Ultra Greedier") fight trivial, as many of his attacks drop coins, thus providing free health.
