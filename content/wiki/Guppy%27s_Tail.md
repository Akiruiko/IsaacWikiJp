 # Guppy's Tail ![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Tail.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants a 1/3 chance of replacing [Room Clear Awards](/wiki/Room_Clear_Awards "Room Clear Awards") with a [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest") or a Locked Chest, but also a 1/3 chance to replace it with nothing at all.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) The effect does not apply to [Coins](/wiki/Coin "Coin") dropped in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode").
* This item belongs to the [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Guppy.


Notes
-------


* The drawback to this item is that Keys become much more scarce, while increasing the amount of Locked Chests. This makes taking Guppy's Tail a potential liability early on.
* Due to any found Chests containing [items](/wiki/Item "Item") while in [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)") or [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room"), Guppy's Tail can be a good way to quickly stack up more upgrades before facing the final boss.
* This item has no effect in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode") other than counting towards the Guppy Transformation.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Eye.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye") [Guppy's Eye](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye"): Makes key management easier by revealing which Locked Chests are worth opening and which are not.
* [(The Left Hand)](/wiki/The_Left_Hand "The Left Hand") [The Left Hand](/wiki/The_Left_Hand "The Left Hand"): Turns all chests into Red Chests, allowing Isaac to get Red Chest items much more quickly. Useful when pursuing the [Guppy transformation](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy").
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Key.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Key "Mom's Key") [Mom's Key](/wiki/Mom%27s_Key "Mom's Key"): Increases the number of drops from Chests and counteracts the increased chance to run into Locked Chests.
