* The item's effect can potentially cause FPS drops.
* Champion enemies become tinted the same color as regular enemies, making it difficult to distinguish them.


Synergies
-----------


* [Active](/wiki/Items#Activated_Collectibles "Items") items: May be used to deal damage without canceling the effect.
* [Chasing familiars](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar"): Familiars like these can chase and damage enemies with little risk. Best ones for the task are [![image](/image/7_Seals.png)](/wiki/7_Seals "7 Seals") [7 Seals](/wiki/7_Seals "7 Seals") and [![image](/image/Daddy_Longlegs.png)](/wiki/Daddy_Longlegs "Daddy Longlegs") [Daddy Longlegs](/wiki/Daddy_Longlegs "Daddy Longlegs"), since they have long aggro range.
* [Orbital](/wiki/Familiar#Orbital_Familiars "Familiar") [familiars](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar"): Enemies can be damaged with little risk, as the camo effect allows Isaac to get close enough for the orbital to deal damage with low risk of taking damage in return.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/120_Volt.png)](/wiki/120_Volt "120 Volt") [120 Volt](/wiki/120_Volt "120 Volt") / (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Jupiter.png)](/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") [Jupiter](/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") / (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Monstrance.png)](/wiki/Monstrance "Monstrance") [Monstrance](/wiki/Monstrance "Monstrance"): Great sources of passive damage without disrupting camo.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Blood_Puppy.png)](/wiki/Blood_Puppy "Blood Puppy") [Blood Puppy](/wiki/Blood_Puppy "Blood Puppy"): Like most enemies, a hostile Blood Puppy will not target Isaac while the camo effect is active, but it will still target and attack other enemies.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Mars.png)](/wiki/Mars "Mars") [Mars](/wiki/Mars "Mars"): Can be used to deal damage without canceling the effect.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): As long as it's not being charged, the knife can deal damage passively.
* (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas"): Gets a lot of use out of Camo Undies due to his in-built [![image](/image/Dark_Arts.png)](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts") [Dark Arts](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts") not disrupting camo.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") / [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") / [![image](/image/Cursed_Eye.png)](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") [Cursed Eye](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") / [![image](/image/Monstro%27s_Lung.png)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") / (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spirit_Sword.png)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") / [![image](/image/Tech_X.png)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): Charging ends the camo effect, and the effect doesn't happen when entering a room with a full charge.
* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Camo Undies will remain active until the tear is moved by pressing a button.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Since the tear follows Isaac, he can run around and use the tear to kill enemies.
		- (Added in Repentance) Tear no longer follows Isaac, but will still not remove Camo effect until moved.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Neptunus.png)](/wiki/Neptunus "Neptunus") [Neptunus](/wiki/Neptunus "Neptunus"): The passive charge of Neptunus does not disrupt Camo.
