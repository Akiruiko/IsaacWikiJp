Effects[]
---------


* Enemies that touch Isaac will bounce off him and propel in the opposite direction. If they hit an obstacle or wall while bouncing, they will take damage.
	+ If an enemy bounces into another enemy, the second enemy will also take damage.
* When an enemy bounces off of Isaac, there's a 50% chance that Isaac won't receive contact damage.
* Additionally grants a 50% chance for projectiles to bounce off of Isaac without taking damage.


Notes[]
-------


* The damage enemies receive when they get bounced into a wall or an obstacle is equal to `8 + 2 * floor`.
	+ The same damage value applies when an enemy gets bounced into by another enemy.
* Enemies that don't deal contact damage cannot be bounced off.
* Bounced off projectiles deal a flat damage that doesn't scale with the current floor or Isaac's stats. This damage is usually 6, but can slightly vary depending on the enemy that shot the projectile.
	+ Lasers cannot be bounced off.
* The bouncing effect also works against [(Fire Place)](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place") [Fire Places](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place") and spiked enemies such as [(Poky)](/wiki/Poky "Poky") [Poky](/wiki/Poky "Poky"), [(Slide)](/wiki/Poky#Slide "Slide") [Slide](/wiki/Poky#Slide "Poky"), and [(Grudge)](/wiki/Poky#Grudge "Grudge") [Grudge](/wiki/Poky#Grudge "Poky"), granting a chance to avoid unintentional damage.
* Isaac can also bounce off [(Fly Bomb)](/wiki/Fly_Bomb "Fly Bomb") [Fly Bombs](/wiki/Fly_Bomb "Fly Bomb") spawned by [(Blaster)](/wiki/Blaster "Blaster") [Blasters](/wiki/Blaster "Blaster") and even deny damage from their explosion.
* [(Bomb)](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb") [Bombs](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb") and [(Troll Bomb)](/wiki/Troll_Bomb "Troll Bomb") [Troll Bombs](/wiki/Troll_Bomb "Troll Bomb") cannot be bounced off.
