 # Equality! ![image](/image/Equality!.png) 

Effects
---------


* All pickups on the ground become their doubled variants as long as Isaac's held pickups are all the same number, e.g. 65 pennies, 65 bombs, 65 keys.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) All single keys, bombs and red hearts in a shop will become free when doubled.
	+ This is likely due to the entity being removed and a double variant being spawned, instead of simply overriding it before it spawns like [(Humbling Bundle)](/wiki/Humbling_Bundle "Humbling Bundle") [Humbling Bundle](/wiki/Humbling_Bundle "Humbling Bundle") does.
* (Removed in Repentance) Upon picking up a non-doubled pickup that makes Isaac's pickups equal in number, a doubled variant will be spawned as well.
* Doubled pickups will not revert if Isaac's pickups become unequal.
* This trinket works well in [Greed mode](/wiki/Greed_mode "Greed mode"), doubling all pennies spawned from completing waves as long as Isaac's pickups are equal.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Hypercoagulation)](/wiki/Hypercoagulation "Hypercoagulation") [Hypercoagulation](/wiki/Hypercoagulation "Hypercoagulation"): As long as Equality is active, all hearts spawned will be doubled and never disappear. Hearts remain on the ground even after the effect is no longer active.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Options?)](/wiki/Options%3F "Options?") [Options?](/wiki/Options%3F "Options?"): While Equality! is active, both rewards can be collected without the other despawning. Options? also makes Equality! easier to keep active.
* [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???"): T.???'s poop pickups are not required for Equality to work, making it much easier to use.
* [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"): Doubled pennies from killed enemies will not despawn. All other coin types will still disappear.
