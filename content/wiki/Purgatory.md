 # Purgatory ![image](/image/Purgatory.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns a red crack in the ground somewhere in the room while Isaac is in a room with enemies. Walking over the crack summons a ghost that homes in on the nearest enemy, exploding when it hits it. After the ghost is summoned, cracks will keep showing up in the room until it is cleared.
	+ The ghost spends one second spawning in before it attacks.
	+ The ghost deals double Isaac's damage per tick, up to 4 times.


Notes
-------


* Only one crack is active at a time.
* The explosion does not hurt Isaac.
* If a crack is stepped on and the room is cleared before the ghost spawns, it will fly to a random location and explode there.
* The explosions from the ghosts will destroy enemy tears.
* Cracks don't spawn in (Challenge Room) [Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room").


Interactions
--------------


* The ghosts aren't considered familiars, therefore they're unaffected by items or trinkets that alter familiars or their behavior, such as [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!")
