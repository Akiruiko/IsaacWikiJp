 # D4 ![image](/image/D4.png) 


Effects
---------


* Isaac's head rotates around his body and can be used to inflict contact damage similar to a [![image](/image/Cube_of_Meat.png)](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") [Cube of Meat](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat"). Blocking tears with Isaac's head does not damage Isaac. His tears still originate from his head, so the line of fire is no longer constant while standing still.
* +1 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").


* -1 [tear delay](/wiki/Tear_delay "Tear delay") (increased rate of fire)
	+ Since this directly affects tear delay instead of changing the tears stat, it allows Isaac's rate of fire to go over the normal maximum rate.
	+ Tear delay decreases are more noticeable and are a greater increase to DPS when the tears stat is high.


* The head orbital deals 7 damage per tick or 105 damage per second ((Added in Repentance) 56 damage per second).


Notes
-------


* (Added in Repentance) Isaac's body will spew a fountain of blood.
* Items that apply contact damage do not apply to the head.


* In combination with other items, it can exceed a three-orbital cap.
* The orbital is larger than most other orbitals, making it easier to use both offensively and defensively.
	+ Despite changing size with Isaac, the orbital's hitbox does not change, which can be deceptive.
* Using this item while near a wall may cause the head to go inside the wall while rotating and block tears shot.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Head orbital does not increase in size, but it does in damage.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Box_of_Friends.png)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends"): Adds another rotating head on each use. Each head increases damage and tears and blocks projectiles. With more heads, it is easier to locate the position of the body, and Box of Friends can be used multiple times in the same room to continue gaining heads.
* [Spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears"): Guillotine can move Isaac's head into walls, which results in lots of wasted shots. Spectral tears allow all shots to have a chance to hit, instead of being wasted by hitting the wall.
* (Added in Repentance)[(The Twins)](/wiki/The_Twins "The Twins") [The Twins](/wiki/The_Twins "The Twins"): Has a chance to add another head, increasing damage and tears.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Berserk!.png)](/wiki/Berserk! "Berserk!") [Berserk!](/wiki/Berserk! "Berserk!") / [(Tainted Samson)](/wiki/Tainted_Samson "Tainted Samson") [Tainted Samson](/wiki/Tainted_Samson "Tainted Samson"): The jawbone fires from Isaac's body, not his head.
* [![image](/image/Big_Fan.png)](/wiki/Big_Fan "Big Fan") [Big Fan](/wiki/Big_Fan "Big Fan"): Slows down rotation speed.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Diplopia.png)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia"): Adds another head and damage up, but only fires tears from one of them. No further tear delay down.
* (Removed in Repentance) (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Duct Tape)](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape") [Duct Tape](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape"): Causes tears to be fired from far below and to the right of Isaac. This causes tears to be out of bounds unless Isaac is standing in the top-left corner of the room.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Tears are fired from whatever position the head is stuck in.
* [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): Attacks with the bone club will come from The Forgotten's body, not his head.
* [![image](/image/Guardian_Angel.png)](/wiki/Guardian_Angel "Guardian Angel") [Guardian Angel](/wiki/Guardian_Angel "Guardian Angel"): Does not increase the head's rotation speed.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): The knife fires from Isaac's body, not his head.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Sacrificial_Altar.png)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar") [Sacrificial Altar](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar"): No effect.
* (Added in Repentance) [![image](/image/Scissors.png)](/wiki/Scissors "Scissors") [Scissors](/wiki/Scissors "Scissors"): Isaac will have two heads: the one from Scissors, who will shoot as normal, and the Guillotine one, which only acts as an orbital.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spin_to_Win.png)](/wiki/Spin_to_Win "Spin to Win") [Spin to Win](/wiki/Spin_to_Win "Spin to Win"): Affects the head, which boosts its damage and defense properties at the cost of shots being harder to hit.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spirit_Sword.png)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword"): The sword is swung from Isaac's body, not his head. This also applies to the sword's projectiles.
* [(Tainted Lilith)](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith") [Tainted Lilith](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith"): The baby fires from Lilith's body, not her head.
* (Added in Repentance) [![image](/image/Tiny_Planet.png)](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") [Tiny Planet](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet"): Tears may fire from the head, but they orbit the body.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Tractor_Beam.png)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): The tears fire from Isaac's body, not his head.
* [![image](/image/Transcendence.png)](/wiki/Transcendence "Transcendence") [Transcendence](/wiki/Transcendence "Transcendence"): Makes Isaac's body invisible, leaving only a shadow where his body is. As a result, Isaac becomes very difficult to control.
