Effects[]
---------


* When picked up, all future [items](/wiki/Items "Items") become "Glitched", causing them to become random combinations of 2-3 effects based on other items.
	+ "Quest" items do not become glitched. This includes: [(The Polaroid)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid"), [(The Negative)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative"), [(Key Piece 1)](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1") [Key Piece 1](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1"), [(Key Piece 2)](/wiki/Key_Piece_2 "Key Piece 2") [Key Piece 2](/wiki/Key_Piece_2 "Key Piece 2"), [(Knife Piece 1)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") [Knife Piece 1](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1"), [(Knife Piece 2)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2"), [(Dad's Note)](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note") [Dad's Note](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note")
	+ Additionally, the currently playing music will fade out. The silence will remain until another music track plays.
	+ Any enemies in the room will also become simultaneously frozen and set on fire.
* "Glitched" items can be passive or active and are completely randomly generated with practically infinite possibilities.
* Random effects combine effects that exist on other items, and assign them to a random event (e.g. on enemy death, on room clear, on damage taken etc.).
	+ These effects may also be derived from installed modded items.
* Glitched items sold for money cost a random amount of pennies up to 99 pennies.


Notes[]
-------


* Once [(Corrupted Data)](/wiki/Corrupted_Data "Corrupted Data") [Corrupted Data](/wiki/Corrupted_Data "Corrupted Data") is unlocked, the TMTRAINER effect may be randomly applied to items found in (Secret Room) [Secret Rooms](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") and (I AM ERROR) [I AM ERROR](/wiki/I_AM_ERROR "I AM ERROR") rooms.
* Items affected by TMTRAINER may take the effect of rerolling all of your items. This includes TMTRAINER itself, meaning any future items you encounter will not be under its effect, nor will the items obtained by rerolling due to the glitched item.
* If an item held by Isaac is rerolled into TMTRAINER (Either by [(D4)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4") or a 1-pip (Dice Room) [Dice Room](/wiki/Dice_Room "Dice Room")), all items after it will be rerolled into glitched items.
* Crashes are commonly encountered in the [DELETE THIS](/wiki/DELETE_THIS "DELETE THIS") challenge, TMTRAINER has the same effect and may be unstable.
