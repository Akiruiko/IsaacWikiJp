[???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)"), (Added in Afterbirth †)  [![image](/image/The_Soul.png)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)"), (Added in Repentance)  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas"),  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas"),  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???"),  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"), or  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany").

Notes
-------


* This item can drop from [Super Pride](/wiki/Super_Pride "Super Pride").
* Resurrection items activate in a [set order](/wiki/Category:Revival_items "Category:Revival items"). Dead Cat is (Removed in Repentance) 3rd / (Added in Repentance) 4th in this order after (Added in Repentance)[(Soul of Lazarus)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Soul of Lazarus") [Soul of Lazarus](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), [![image](/image/1up!.png)](/wiki/1up! "1up!") [1up!](/wiki/1up! "1up!"), and  [(Lazarus)](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus") [Lazarus](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus")' extra life.
* (Removed in Afterbirth) Picking this up as  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") would not show the number of remaining lives, but will still function.
* (Added in Afterbirth †) If picked up as  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"), his Bone Hearts are reduced to 1 but  [![image](/image/The_Soul.png)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)")'s Soul Hearts remain unaffected. The reverse is also true.
* The lives are added after the "picking up an item" animation has ended, so characters that die while the animation is playing will not be revived by this item.
* (Removed in Repentance) The effects of the [![image](/image/D4.png)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4"), [![image](/image/D100.png)](/wiki/D100 "D100") [D100](/wiki/D100 "D100"), [![image](/image/Missing_No..png)](/wiki/Missing_No. "Missing No.") [Missing No.](/wiki/Missing_No. "Missing No."), or a 1- or 6-pip (Dice Room) [Dice Room](/wiki/Dice_Room "Dice Room") will not remove the lives granted by this item.
* Additional Dead Cats can be picked up during a run, increasing lives well past 9. (Removed in Repentance) Only the first dead cat counts toward becoming Guppy.
* (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) This item counts as 9 items, so if Isaac is trying for an early portal to after beating [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom"), this will significantly boost the progress closer to 20 items.
* (Added in Repentance) If  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") take the item, only the brother who takes it will be set to one Red Heart Container on pickup. But if they die, both are resurrected with one Red Heart Container.
* (Added in Repentance) If  [(Tainted Jacob)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") [Tainted Jacob](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") takes this item after being touched by [Dark Esau](/wiki/Dark_Esau "Dark Esau"), he will return to his previous Red Heart total upon reaching the next floor.
	+ Dying as Tainted Jacob after being touched by Dark Esau and carrying this item will respawn him in the previous room in his lost form. Making it to the next floor will still return him to his previous Red Heart total.
