 # Psy Fly ![image](/image/Psy_Fly.png) 


Effects
---------


* Spawns a fly [orbital familiar](/wiki/Orbital_familiar "Orbital familiar") that chases and blocks enemy shots.
	+ After a certain amount of shots are blocked, it enters a short cooldown period where it still blocks shots, but does not actively chase them.
* Psy Fly also deals 1 contact damage to enemies per tick (15 per second).
* Turns some [Fly](/wiki/Fly "Fly") enemies into friendly Blue Flies if it touches them while blocking shots (but not on the return trip).
	+ Flies affected include: [Army Fly](/wiki/Army_Fly "Army Fly"), [Attack Fly](/wiki/Attack_Fly "Attack Fly"), [Fly](/wiki/Fly "Fly"), [Ring Fly](/wiki/Ring_Fly "Ring Fly"), [Swarm Fly](/wiki/Swarm_Fly "Swarm Fly"), and [Willo](/wiki/Willo "Willo").
* This item belongs to the [Beelzebub](/wiki/Beelzebub "Beelzebub") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a giant humanoid fly.


Notes
-------


* While Psy Fly is an effective means of projectile protection, it is not immunity, and recklessly wading into a barrage of shots can easily result in taking damage.
* Psy Fly will block most types of projectiles, not just red bullets. This includes the fires from [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") phase 2, the bone projectiles [Bonies](/wiki/Bony "Bony") throw, or even the rocks that the [Kineti](/wiki/Polty "Polty") throws at you.
* Enemy Flies touched by Psy Fly can die if their HP is low enough, which does not convert them into Blue Flies.
