 # Gimpy ![image](/image/Gimpy.png) 


Effects
---------


* When Isaac takes damage, there is a chance that a [Soul Heart](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") may spawn.
* [Monsters](/wiki/Monster "Monster") have a chance to drop a [Half Red Heart](/wiki/Half_Red_Heart "Half Red Heart") after being killed.


Notes
-------


* Gimpy's Soul Heart drop chance depends on the [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck") stat, and goes up to 50% at 22 Luck.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Blood_Oath.png)](/wiki/Blood_Oath "Blood Oath") [Blood Oath](/wiki/Blood_Oath "Blood Oath"): For each half heart damaged by Blood Oath, Gimpy has a chance to drop a soul heart. Synergy further improves with luck.


* [![image](/image/Dark_Bum.png)](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum") [Dark Bum](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum"): Dark Bum can collect the Half Red Hearts that enemies drop, which when combined with the chance to drop Soul Hearts when damaged, is a good way to generate Soul and [Black Hearts](/wiki/Hearts#Black_Heart "Hearts") as well as other pickups.
