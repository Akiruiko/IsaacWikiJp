 # Crow Heart ![image](/image/Crow_Heart.png) 

Effect
--------


* [Red Heart](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health") damage will be taken before [Soul Heart](/wiki/Health#Soul_Hearts "Health"), [Black Heart](/wiki/Health#Black_Hearts "Health"), and (Added in Repentance) [Rotten Heart](/wiki/Health#Rotten_Hearts "Health") damage.
	+ With [Bone Hearts](/wiki/Health#Bone_Hearts "Health"), Red Hearts contained within the Bone Hearts will be taken before regular Red Heart damage, but the Bone Hearts will not be fully depleted.
	+ If Isaac only has half a Red Heart left, Soul and Black Heart damage will be taken, and Bone Hearts can be destroyed.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) This is useful for getting into (Boss Challenge Room) [Boss Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Boss_Challenge_Room "Boss Challenge Room") when you want to maintain your Soul/Black Hearts but have more than one filled Red Heart container.
* Red Heart damage taken via the trinket affects your (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room")/(Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") chances normally.
	+ As a result, this trinket makes Soul/Black Hearts useless at protecting Devil/Angel Room chances.
	+ Bone Hearts will be emptied before Red Hearts, making them very valuable to protect your Devil/Angel room chances.
* This is useful when playing as  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"), as it will preserve his Bone Hearts (and Devil/Angel Room chance) until all of his Bone Hearts are empty.
	+ This trinket does nothing while controlling  [(The Soul)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)").
