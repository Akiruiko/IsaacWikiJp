 # Eve's Mascara ![image](/image/Eve%27s_Mascara.png) 


Effects
---------


* Isaac shouts, damaging and pushing away nearby enemies.
	+ The item can be used when not fully charged, but deals more damage and has increased range the more charges it has when used.
	+ The damage the shout deals is 20 + 28 per charge used.
		- The shout also deals extra ticks of damage to enemies that are close enough. These extra ticks deal damage equal to 2.5 + 3.5 per charge used, and can tick a number of times up to half the charges used (rounding up).
			* The range of the extra ticks also varies depending on the charges used: enemies that are closer to Isaac will receive more ticks of damage.
	+ The shout is able to destroy [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles"), such as [rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks"), [(Poop)](/wiki/Poop "Poop") [Poops](/wiki/Poop "Poop") and [(Fire Place)](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place") [Fire Places](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place") and open bombable doors, including [Bedroom](/wiki/Bedroom "Bedroom") and (Secret Room) [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") doors.
* Larynx gains 1 charge whenever Isaac takes damage, as well as through normal means.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/The_Battery.png)](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery") [The Battery](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery"): Larynx can hold up to two full charges. Only up to 12 charges will be used at a time.
* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns red wisps on the middle ring. The wisps deals contact damage equal to 30% of Isaac's damage * Charges Used. Charges Used equals the number of charges Larynx had at the time it was used. Health = `1 * Charges Used`. Tear Damage = `1.5 * Charges Used`.
* [![image](/image/Habit.png)](/wiki/Habit "Habit") [Habit](/wiki/Habit "Habit"): Both on-hit charge effects stack, charging 2 points per hit.
* [(Hairpin)](/wiki/Hairpin "Hairpin") [Hairpin](/wiki/Hairpin "Hairpin"): Fully recharges Larynx at the beginning of boss fights, giving Isaac a way to easily devastate several bosses.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/9_Volt.png)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt"): The first bar gains an automatic recharge, but the further bars will not be affected.
* [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): **Very poor combination.** Absorbing Larynx and using it through Void will cause Isaac to only perform the 1-charge version regardless of how many times he has taken damage or how many charges Void has, resulting in minimal damage.
