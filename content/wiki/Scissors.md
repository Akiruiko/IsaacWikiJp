 # Scissors ![image](/image/Scissors.png) 

Effects
---------


* Detaches Isaac's head from his body and turns the head into a stationary [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that fires tears for the current [room](/wiki/Room "Room").
	+ The player still controls Isaac's headless body, which also shoots tears.
		- (Added in Repentance) The body constantly spews a controllable fountain of blood shots, dealing about 0.66x-1.01x damage.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The tears fired by the head do not scale with Isaac's damage and always do 3.5 damage.
		- (Added in Repentance) The head's tears are affected by Isaac's stats and attack modifiers.


Notes
-------


* Can spawn multiple heads if used in the same room more than once.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Only the most recent head is able to fire.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") and [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology") are not fired from the stationary head.
* If Isaac has an invisible body due to the cosmetic effect of [![image](/image/Transcendence.png)](/wiki/Transcendence "Transcendence") [Transcendence](/wiki/Transcendence "Transcendence"), only a shadow will be seen after using the Scissors.
* If Isaac is [Blindfolded](/wiki/Blindfolded "Blindfolded"), the floating head can still fire tears.
* (Added in Repentance) The floating head does nothing as  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith"),  [(Tainted Lilith)](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith") [Tainted Lilith](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith"), and  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten").
	+ As  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"), the floating head will only fire tears when the Soul is active.
	+ The floating head will not fire tears as  [(Tainted Samson)](/wiki/Tainted_Samson "Tainted Samson") [Tainted Samson](/wiki/Tainted_Samson "Tainted Samson") while he is enraged.
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) Each wave of [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") fully recharges the item, allowing many heads to be spawned.
* Only deaths which end runs (i.e. Isaac is not revived by a revival item such as [![image](/image/1up!.png)](/wiki/1up! "1up!") [1up!](/wiki/1up! "1up!")) count towards unlocking the Scissors.


Synergies
