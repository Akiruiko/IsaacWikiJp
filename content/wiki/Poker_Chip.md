 # Poker Chip ![image](/image/Poker_Chip.png) 

Effects
---------


* If a [chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest") would contain hearts, coins, bombs and/or keys, it has a 50/50 chance to either drop extra consumables or replace all of its contents with an [Attack Fly](/wiki/Attack_Fly "Attack Fly").
* The trinket has no effect on Red Chests, or if the chest would contain a pill, a card, a trinket or an item.
	+ Consequently, the Chip has no effect in [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)") or [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room").


Notes
-------


* (Added in Repentance) Has no effect on [Old Chests](/wiki/Old_Chest "Old Chest").
* (Added in Repentance) When opening a [Mega Chest](/wiki/Mega_Chest "Mega Chest") yields pickups, it can spawn 1-2 Attack Flies alongside the pickups.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Guppy's Eye)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye") [Guppy's Eye](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye"): Provided the Poker Chip is not smelted, it can be used in conjunction with the eye to open all chests with extra pickups, while dropping the chip for any chests containing flies, nullifying the downside of the trinket.
