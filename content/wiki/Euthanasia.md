Effects[]
---------


* Adds a chance to fire needles which deal triple Isaac's [tear damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
	+ Needles will instantly kill [regular enemies](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters") and cause them to burst into 10 more tears in all directions.
	+ The chance to fire a needle depends on [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").
		- At base luck (0), it is 3.33%
		- (Removed in Repentance)It is 100% at 15 luck.
		- (Added in Repentance)It maxes out at 50% with 15 luck.
* This item belongs to the [Spun](/wiki/Spun "Spun") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a buff berserker.


Notes[]
-------


* The needle tears can kill enemies that are normally invincible, such as [Peep](/wiki/Peep "Peep")'s eyes, [Death's Heads](/wiki/Death%27s_Head "Death's Head"), and [Stoneys](/wiki/Stoney "Stoney").
* The needle tears can kill [Grimaces](/wiki/Stone_Grimace "Stone Grimace"), allowing Isaac to permanently remove any obstacle in a room.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The needle tears can kill [Bomb Grimaces](/wiki/Stone_Grimace "Stone Grimace"), dropping 10 unlit Throwable Bombs. This can make it detrimental to shoot at them, since they are usually provided as a tool rather than an obstacle.
* Possible needle tears in a burst from killing an enemy do not retain the instant kill and burst-causing capabilities, but still deal triple damage. This prevents chain reactions of bursts.
* The tears in the burst are larger than normal but do not have a damage bonus.
* Unless piercing is obtained, [Knights](/wiki/Knight "Knight") will still block the needles if shot from the front.
