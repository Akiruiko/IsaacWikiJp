Effects
---------


* +1 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
* Increases the chance for [champion enemies](/wiki/Champion "Champion") to appear by 15%.


Notes
-------


* While more champions likely mean a tougher run, players will also profit from a higher amount of [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") available to them, thanks to many champions dropping items upon death.
* The belt does not affect the appearance rate of champion [bosses](/wiki/Boss "Boss").
* This is one of the only raw DMG up's in the [shop item pool](/wiki/Shop_(Item_Pool) "Shop (Item Pool)").
* (Added in Afterbirth â€ ) The chance for champions to appear does not increase in [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void").


Interactions
--------------


* [(Purple Heart)](/wiki/Purple_Heart "Purple Heart") [Purple Heart](/wiki/Purple_Heart "Purple Heart"): Champion Belt's increased chance is also doubled.
