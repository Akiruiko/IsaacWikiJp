 # Diplopia ![image](/image/Diplopia.png) 

Effect
--------


* Duplicates all [pickups](/wiki/Pickup "Pickup") and pedestal [items](/wiki/Item "Item") in the current room, then disappears.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Using Diplopia on a [trinket](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket") will spawn another random trinket instead of duplicating the trinket.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Using Diplopia on a trinket does nothing.
* (Added in Repentance) Does not duplicate [(Rune of Jera)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Jera") [Rune of Jera](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes").
* (Removed in Afterbirth †) Using Diplopia on an empty item pedestal will spawn another random item.
* If used in a [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop"), the duplicated pickups and items can be taken for free.
* (Removed in Repentance) If used in the [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") room, all available items will be duplicated and all the duplicates can be taken (**this will still start the Boss Rush**); however, only one of the original items may be taken. Taking one of the original items does not cause the duplicates to disappear.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Only one duplicate can be taken.
* (Removed in Repentance) If used on the [![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") and [![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") after defeating [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom"), the duplicates can be taken without affecting the originals.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Only one duplicate can be taken.
* If item pedestal that is duplicated is visable as "?" (for example with the [Curse of the Blind](/wiki/Curse_of_the_Blind "Curse of the Blind")), duplicate will be visable as "?" until taken, just like the original item pedestal.
* (Added in Repentance) If used in a [Treasure room](/wiki/Treasure_room "Treasure room") on the alternate path, only one duplicate can be taken. However, this allows Isaac to essentially take both items.
* If used in a [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") or the [Black Market](/wiki/Black_Market "Black Market"), the duplicated items can be taken for free. The original items will still be offered at an HP price, and Deal with the Devil precedent will not be obtained.
* (Removed in Repentance) If used in an [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") that has multiple [item](/wiki/Item "Item") pedestals, the duplicated items can be taken for free. The original items will still behave as normal: once an item is chosen, the others will disappear.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Only one duplicate can be taken.
* (Removed in Repentance) Picking up multiple copies of items that can cause Isaac to [transform](/wiki/Transformation "Transformation") will not count towards transformation progress.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Multiple copies of the same item do count towards transformations.
* Using Diplopia on another copy of Diplopia will not work.
* [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") can use this item to duplicate an active item to each have the same active item.
* Tear-boosting items, if stacked, cap at shooting 16 tears at once.
