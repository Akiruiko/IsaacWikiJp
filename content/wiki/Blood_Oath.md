Effects[]
---------


* Grants a large [orbital](/wiki/Familiar#Orbital_Familiars "Familiar") similar to [Teratoma](/wiki/Teratoma "Teratoma") that slowly orbits Isaac.
	+ The orbital repels enemies that touch it and deals 3.5 contact damage to enemies, once per second.
* After blocking 3 shots and/or dealing 3 ticks of contact damage, the orbital splits into two smaller ones that orbit opposite of each other. They behave the same as the original, except they are smaller and can only take 2 hits before being destroyed, bursting into 3 [blue spiders](/wiki/Blue_spider "Blue spider") in the process.
	+ 5 seconds after both orbitals are destroyed, the original, full-size orbital respawns.
