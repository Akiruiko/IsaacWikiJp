 # Goat Head ![image](/image/Goat_Head.png) 


Effects
---------


* A [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") / [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") Door will always spawn after every boss fight, excluding first floor and floors after [Chapter 4](/wiki/Chapter_4 "Chapter 4").
	+ The spawned door will not disappear when leaving and re-entering the boss room.


Notes
-------


* The precise effect involves setting the [Devil Room chance](/wiki/Devil_Room#Conditions_to_make_Devil_Rooms_appear "Devil Room") to 100%, regardless of other effects.
	+ Even if taken after a boss is killed, Goat Head will force a Devil / Angel Room door to spawn on that floor.
* Accepting a deal with the Devil will prevent any Angel Rooms from appearing, meaning that Isaac needs to acquire the Goat Head in a [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room"),(Removed in Repentance) [Locked Chest](/wiki/Locked_Chest "Locked Chest"),(Removed in Afterbirth)[Red Chest](/wiki/Red_Chest "Red Chest"), from [The Fallen](/wiki/The_Fallen "The Fallen") or with [(Credit Card)](/wiki/Credit_Card "Credit Card") [Credit Card](/wiki/Credit_Card "Credit Card"), which would allow Angel Rooms to open.
	+ Getting deals from satanic bible now affects the Angel rooms chance.
* (Removed in Afterbirth) Goat Head and [![image](/image/The_Book_of_Belial.png)](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") [The Book of Belial](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") are the only items that will ensure Angel/Devil Rooms on every floor between The Basement I and Utero II.
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) Goat Head will not force a Devil / Angel Room door to open if the boss fight was in a narrow room.
* (Added in Afterbirth) Goat Head has no effect in [Greed mode](/wiki/Greed_mode "Greed mode") and is not normally available.
	+ It can still be a starting item for  [(Eden)](/wiki/Eden "Eden") [Eden](/wiki/Eden "Eden"), a bonus item from (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Eden%27s_Blessing.png)](/wiki/Eden%27s_Blessing "Eden's Blessing") [Eden's Blessing](/wiki/Eden%27s_Blessing "Eden's Blessing") and is obtainable with [![image](/image/Pandora%27s_Box.png)](/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box "Pandora's Box") [Pandora's Box](/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box "Pandora's Box") and (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Sacrificial_Altar.png)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar") [Sacrificial Altar](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar").
