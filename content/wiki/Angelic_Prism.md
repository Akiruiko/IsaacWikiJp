 # Angelic Prism ![image](/image/Angelic_Prism.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns an [orbital familiar](/wiki/Familiar#Orbital_Familiars "Familiar") with a large orbital radius. Tears that pass through the prism split into four multi-colored tears.


Notes
-------


* It will also quadruple [shooting familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") tears.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Akeldama.png)](/wiki/Akeldama "Akeldama") [Akeldama](/wiki/Akeldama "Akeldama"): Turns the chain of tears into four multi-colored chains.
* [![image](/image/Anti-Gravity.png)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): Tears that are floating in the air when they hit the prism will quadruple but will not move. Tears that begin moving before they hit the prism will travel outwards normally.
	+ By releasing the built up tears as the prism passes by, significantly more tears can be affected than normal.
* [(Duct Tape)](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape") [Duct Tape](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape"): By keeping the prism in the same spot, damage output can be significantly increased in that direction.
	+ **Duct Tape** + [![image](/image/Incubus.png)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus"): By stacking the incubus familiar on top of the prism before picking up Duct Tape, the shots will be affected no matter what direction Isaac is firing.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Immaculate_Heart.png)](/wiki/Immaculate_Heart "Immaculate Heart") [Immaculate Heart](/wiki/Immaculate_Heart "Immaculate Heart"): The extra spectral tears share the same orbit as Angelic Prism, making them very easy to split.
* [![image](/image/Jacob%27s_Ladder.png)](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder") [Jacob's Ladder](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder"): All of the split tears will be electrified. Also, electric arcs that pass through the prism will be split.
* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): While the tear is in contact with the prism, it will fire 4 additional tears in cardinal directions at Isaac's tear rate.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Saturnus.png)](/wiki/Saturnus "Saturnus") [Saturnus](/wiki/Saturnus "Saturnus"): Since the prism and the orbiting tears have the exact same orbital radius, orbiting tears will immediately be split into 28 multi-colored tears upon entering a room.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Sharp_Key.png)](/wiki/Sharp_Key "Sharp Key") [Sharp Key](/wiki/Sharp_Key "Sharp Key"): Key projectiles can split thru the prism, leading to potentially massive damage.
* [![image](/image/Tractor_Beam.png)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): Tears will split but continue stacked on top of each other along the tractor beam, essentially quadrupling the shot's damage.
