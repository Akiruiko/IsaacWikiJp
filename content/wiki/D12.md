* [Rainbow Poop](/wiki/Rainbow_Poop "Rainbow Poop"), [Golden Poop](/wiki/Golden_Poop "Golden Poop"), and [Tinted Rocks](/wiki/Tinted_Rock "Tinted Rock") are much less likely to be created by the D12 than all other obstacles.

* The D12 will not re-roll [Key Blocks](/wiki/Key_Block "Key Block") or [Fire Places](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place"). It also won't re-roll [(Stone Grimace)](/wiki/Stone_Grimace "Stone Grimace") [Stone Grimaces](/wiki/Stone_Grimace "Stone Grimace"), or other enemies.
* (Added in Repentance) The D12 will not re-roll [Spiked Rocks](/wiki/Spiked_Rock "Spiked Rock"), [(Fool's Gold)](/wiki/Fool%27s_Gold "Fool's Gold") [Fool's Gold](/wiki/Fool%27s_Gold "Fool's Gold") Rocks, [Pillars](/wiki/Pillars "Pillars"), or [Marked Skulls](/wiki/Marked_Skull "Marked Skull").
