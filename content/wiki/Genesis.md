Effects[]
---------


* On use, the character, including [stats](/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") and all items but initial items, is reset and teleported to a unique (Clean Bedroom) [Clean Bedroom](/wiki/Clean_Bedroom "Clean Bedroom") that acts like an (I AM ERROR) [I AM ERROR](/wiki/I_AM_ERROR "I AM ERROR") room. It has a [Bed](/wiki/Bed "Bed"), two random [Chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest"), two [Sacks](/wiki/Sack "Sack"), and a random [Trinket](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket"). The only way out is through the beam of light.
	+ This includes resetting the character to the initial one even if they had transformed due to items such as [(Ankh)](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") [Ankh](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh").
* For every item removed using Genesis, there will be a set of three items from the removed item's pool to choose from, each set appearing one after the other.
* If used on one of the final floors of the game, such as [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)"), [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room"), or [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void"), the beam of light will be replaced with a (Crawl Space) [Crawl Space](/wiki/Crawl_Space "Crawl Space") that leads Isaac back to the starting room of the floor he used it on. In addition, the aforementioned chests will include items. These items will not disappear along the "choice" pedestals. The Mega Satan Door will remain open if it was opened earlier.
* If used during [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast")'s fight, it will merely teleport Isaac to the middle of the room, removing no items from him.
* If used in [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)"), the beam will teleport Isaac to [(Cathedral)](/wiki/Cathedral "Cathedral") [Cathedral](/wiki/Cathedral "Cathedral").


Notes[]
-------


* Genesis will remove all currently active [curses](/wiki/Curses "Curses"), meaning Curse of the Blind will not affect the item pedestals present inside the room.
* If used as  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"), both character's items are removed to offer choices, but Jacob and Esau cannot take two items at once from the choices.
* If used as  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus"), both form's items are removed to offer choices, while his initial [(Flip)](/wiki/Flip "Flip") [Flip](/wiki/Flip "Flip") is granted infinite charges and can be used freely in the special room.
* [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") will lose all of her [(Lemegeton)](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") [Lemegeton](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") wisps upon use, but not her red heart charges. This allows her to quickly gather power again after the reset.
* If used as  [(Eden)](/wiki/Eden "Eden") [Eden](/wiki/Eden "Eden"), a new set of items and stats will be generated. The first random passive item Eden starts with is rerolled immediately with no choice of three.
* If Isaac uses Genesis while in [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") / [(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines") / [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") or their variants, the trapdoor can send him back to the regular floors unintentionally.
	+ Using Genesis after defeating [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") on [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") II will teleport Isaac to a room that is empty besides a trapdoor leading to [(Corpse)](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse") [Corpse](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse") I and the three item selections.
* Since Genesis resets Isaac's health, it is one way to remove [Broken Hearts](/wiki/Health#Broken_Hearts "Health").
* (Crawl Space) [Crawl Spaces](/wiki/Crawl_Space "Crawl Space") can be generated and entered inside the Genesis room, but upon leaving them, Isaac will be returned to the floor Genesis was used on instead of returning to the room.
	+ Similarly, a [Red Chest](/wiki/Chests#Red_Chest "Chests") or [(Joker)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Joker") [Joker](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") can teleport Isaac to a (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") or (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room"), and leaving will return Isaac to the room Genesis was used in.
* [Item tables](/wiki/Item_Pool "Item Pool") will not be reset, however any lost items can be obtained again if they spawn.
* Using Genesis will remove some important items (such as [(Knife Piece 1)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") [Knife Piece 1](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") or 2), but not others (like [(The Polaroid)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid"), [(The Negative)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative"), [(Key Piece 1)](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1") [Key Piece 1](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1") or 2, etc.).
* Take caution; choosing an active item while holding another one will not drop the previous item to the ground, but replace it.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Replaces all of Isaac's wisps with 3 normal wisps, in addition to its other effects.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(? Card)](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") [? Card](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card"): IfÂ ? Card is used in place of Genesis, Genesis will be counted as an extra item for the choice set.
* [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") /  [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel"): Both have the ability to return to the floor Genesis was used on, due to them starting with a [(0 - The Fool)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "0 - The Fool") [0 - The Fool](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") card.
* [(Crooked Penny)](/wiki/Crooked_Penny "Crooked Penny") [Crooked Penny](/wiki/Crooked_Penny "Crooked Penny"): Using it on the choice pedestals has the 50/50 chance of duplicating them as normal, or make them disappear, in which case no new ones will spawn.
* [(D7)](/wiki/D7 "D7") [D7](/wiki/D7 "D7"): Using it will spawn three items, all of which can be taken.
* [(Damocles)](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles") [Damocles](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles") / [(Missing No.)](/wiki/Missing_No. "Missing No.") [Missing No.](/wiki/Missing_No. "Missing No."): Genesis removes these items as well.
* [(Echo Chamber)](/wiki/Echo_Chamber "Echo Chamber") [Echo Chamber](/wiki/Echo_Chamber "Echo Chamber"): The consumable pool is reset when Genesis is used, so if it's re-obtained after using Genesis, the previously stored consumable types won't be activated.
* [(Eden's Blessing)](/wiki/Eden%27s_Blessing "Eden's Blessing") [Eden's Blessing](/wiki/Eden%27s_Blessing "Eden's Blessing"): Using Genesis after collecting the blessing during the run will spawn Isaac in the Genesis room already holding a random item. This consumes Eden's Blessing, and the next run Isaac starts will not begin with a random item.
* [(Esau Jr.)](/wiki/Esau_Jr. "Esau Jr.") [Esau Jr.](/wiki/Esau_Jr. "Esau Jr."): Using Genesis as Esau Jr. will revert back to the original character.
* [(Glowing Hour Glass)](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass") [Glowing Hour Glass](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass"): Using it works as intended and will give back all previous stats, items, pickups, and health.
* [(Magic Skin)](/wiki/Magic_Skin "Magic Skin") [Magic Skin](/wiki/Magic_Skin "Magic Skin"): Genesis **does not** remove the downside of Magic Skin; any of the choice pedestals can be replaced by Magic Skin.
* [(Pandora's Box)](/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box "Pandora's Box") [Pandora's Box](/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box "Pandora's Box"): Using it inside the Genesis room will spawn [(The Bible)](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") [The Bible](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible"). Picking it up does not affect the choice pedestals.
* [(Teleport!)](/wiki/Teleport! "Teleport!") [Teleport!](/wiki/Teleport! "Teleport!") / [(Teleport 2.0)](/wiki/Teleport_2.0 "Teleport 2.0") [Teleport 2.0](/wiki/Teleport_2.0 "Teleport 2.0") / [Telepills](/wiki/Pills "Pills") / [Teleport Cards](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Should such items/consumables be obtained in the Genesis room, they can be used to circumvent the forced floor skip.
	+ In the case of pills, unidentified pills should only be popped *after* taking all of the items, for the Genesis room cannot be returned to after leaving.
* [(Wild Card)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Wild Card") [Wild Card](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Can't activate Genesis.
