Effects[]
---------


* (Removed in Repentance) +1.0 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
* After firing tears for 2.35 seconds, releasing the fire button unleashes a black [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") ring around Isaac that expands and contracts, dealing damage at a rapid rate to all enemies touching it.
	+ The charge is completed when a red upside-down cross appears on Isaac's forehead.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) With charge bars enabled, there is also an indicator that displays the charge.
	+ The black ring deals damage equal to Isaac's current damage per tick, and ticks a total of 30 times. It lasts ~1.97 seconds (118 frames).
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Enemies killed by the black ring have a 5% chance to drop [Black Hearts](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart").
		- Black Hearts will drop as soon as the enemy is killed. (In other words, the heart will drop at the beginning of the death animation rather than at the end of the death animation.)
* This item belongs to the [Leviathan](/wiki/Leviathan "Leviathan") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Leviathan.


Notes[]
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) This item does not work while playing a [blindfolded](/wiki/Blindfolded "Blindfolded") character, as it requires tears to charge.
	+ This restriction can, however, be bypassed by picking up [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique").
	+ This item's effect will not fully activate if picked up by  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith"); its stat ups will still apply to her [(Incubus)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") familiar, but the ring will not appear unless she also has the Ludovico Technique.
* (Added in Repentance) This item will still work while playing as a [blindfolded](/wiki/Blindfolded "Blindfolded") character.
* The ring will apply any tear status effects such as [poison](/wiki/Poison "Poison") if Isaac has them.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy"): Damaging enemies with Maw of the Void allows flies to spawn from the Guppy transformation.

The spawned flies will also move to attack the nearest enemy immediately.
