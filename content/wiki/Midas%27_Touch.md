Effects
---------


* Isaac now spawns friendly [Blue Spiders](/wiki/Familiar#Blue_Spiders "Familiar") when firing tears.
* Heals Isaac for 1 [red heart](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health") upon pickup.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Yes Mother?](/wiki/Yes_Mother%3F "Yes Mother?") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into his mother.


Notes
-------


* The spiders are spawned when Isaac is shooting, and up to 5 spiders can be spawned at the same time. More spiders can be spawned if the previous ones died.
* The spider spawning chance depends on the [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck") stat and goes up to 100% with 10 Luck.
* (Removed in Repentance) This item does not work for Lilith since (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Incubus.png)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") tears do not count as her tears.
* Spiders can still be spawned in rooms without enemies.
