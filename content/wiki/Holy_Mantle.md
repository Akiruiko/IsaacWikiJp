 # Holy Mantle ![image](/image/Holy_Mantle.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants a shield that negates the first instance of damage taken, once per room.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Seraphim](/wiki/Seraphim_(Transformation) "Seraphim (Transformation)") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into an angel.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) When the shield is broken, Isaac gets invincibility frames like he does when he would normally take damage, based on the damage it negated; 1 second for half a heart of damage, 2 seconds for a full heart, and 4 seconds for 2 full hearts.
* (Added in Repentance) Holy Mantle breaking only grants one second of invincibility frames, regardless of the damage source.
* (Removed in Repentance) Holy Mantle won't be active when initially appearing in the starting room of a floor if it was lost in the room where Isaac left the previous floor.
* As the shield gets restored whenever another room is entered, Holy Mantle allows (Curse Room) [Curse Rooms](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") to be entered and left without taking damage.
* Unlike every other protective effect, Holy Mantle (and similar effects) does not prevent damage from [(Blood Donation Machine.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/6/6e/Blood_Donation_Machine.png/revision/latest?cb=20210821075842) [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Machines#Blood_Donation_Machine "Machines"), [(Devil Beggar.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/b/b6/Devil_Beggar.png/revision/latest?cb=20210821101216) [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Beggar#Devil_Beggar "Beggar"), and [![image](/image/Blood_Rights.png)](/wiki/Blood_Rights "Blood Rights") [Blood Rights](/wiki/Blood_Rights "Blood Rights").
	+ (Removed in Repentance) However, Blood Donation Machines and Devil Beggars can be played practically for free during the invincibility frames granted when losing the shield, by taking damage from touching a [(Fire Place)](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place") [Fire Place](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place"), etc.
* Damage from (Sacrifice Room) [Sacrifice Room](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room") spikes can be blocked by Holy Mantle, no payout is rewarded.
* The blocked hit does not count as damage taken for related achievements and will not trigger items that activate upon taking damage, like [![image](/image/Dead_Bird.png)](/wiki/Dead_Bird "Dead Bird") [Dead Bird](/wiki/Dead_Bird "Dead Bird").
* (Added in Afterbirth)  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") starts with this item after donating 879 coins to the [(Greed Donation Machine.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/a/ac/Greed_Donation_Machine.png/revision/latest?cb=20190404221730) [Greed Donation Machine](/wiki/Machines#Greed_Donation_Machine "Machines").
* (Added in Repentance) When Holy Mantle's shield is broken, a white cross symbol will briefly appear overlaid on top of Isaac and a smashing sound will play.
* (Added in Repentance) While Holy Mantle is in effect, a blue cross icon appears in the HUD, next to Isaac's life.
