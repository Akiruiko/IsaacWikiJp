 # Butt Bombs ![image](/image/Butt_Bombs.png) 


Effects
---------


* Gives Isaac an extra life. Upon death, he will respawn in the most recent non-hostile room with full health, after which 1up! will disappear.
	+ If Isaac has no Red Heart Containers, he'll respawn with a Half [Soul Heart](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") instead.
* The 1up! mushroom begins following Isaac like a familiar upon pickup, but doesn't do anything. It disappears when its life is used up.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Fun Guy](/wiki/Fun_Guy "Fun Guy") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a walking mushroom.
