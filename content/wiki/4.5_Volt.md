 # 4.5 Volt ![image](/image/4.5_Volt.png) 

Effects
---------


* Causes Isaac's active item to charge when Isaac deals damage to enemies, rather than when he clears rooms.
	+ Damage dealt by active items work as well.
* Charges are gained at a rate equal the following formula: ((40 + 20) x stage). For example:
	+ In [(Basement)](/wiki/Basement "Basement") [Basement](/wiki/Basement "Basement") I / [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") I, it takes 60 damage to gain 1 charge.
	+ In [(Caves)](/wiki/Caves "Caves") [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") II / [(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines") II, it takes 120 damage.
	+ In [(Womb)](/wiki/Womb "Womb") [Womb](/wiki/Womb "Womb") I / [(Corpse)](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse") [Corpse](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse") I, it takes 180 damage.
	+ In [(Sheol)](/wiki/Sheol "Sheol") [Sheol](/wiki/Sheol "Sheol") / [(Cathedral)](/wiki/Cathedral "Cathedral") [Cathedral](/wiki/Cathedral "Cathedral"), it takes 240 damage.
	+ In [(Home)](/wiki/Home "Home") [Home](/wiki/Home "Home"), it takes 300 damage.
	+ [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent") floors use the values of their regular floors, meaning the amount of damage 4.5 Volt needs to gain charges steadily decreases during the Ascent sequence until reaching Home.
* Multiple charges cannot be gained at once.
* Overkill damage does not count towards a charge.


Notes
-------


* Tainted characters with active items in their pill/card slot will not have those items charged by 4.5 Volt if their active item isn't already fully charged.
* [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") will benefit from 4.5 Volt's effect for regular item charges while retaining her ability to use soul hearts as item charges. This applies to  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") with her red heart charges as well.


Synergies
-----------


* [(Door Stop)](/wiki/Door_Stop "Door Stop") [Door Stop](/wiki/Door_Stop "Door Stop") / [![image](/image/Mercurius.png)](/wiki/Mercurius "Mercurius") [Mercurius](/wiki/Mercurius "Mercurius") / any means of room resetting (infinite bombs): Provides infinite charges by clearing some enemies then leaving the room, and repeating.
* [![image](/image/Jumper_Cables.png)](/wiki/Jumper_Cables "Jumper Cables") [Jumper Cables](/wiki/Jumper_Cables "Jumper Cables"): Increases the rate of charge by appending its 15-kills-per-charge quality on top of 4.5 Volt's damage-based charge.
* [(Old Capacitor)](/wiki/Old_Capacitor "Old Capacitor") [Old Capacitor](/wiki/Old_Capacitor "Old Capacitor"): Since the 4.5 Volt also makes it so that active items don't charge when clearing rooms, this trinket can be picked up with no downside.
* [![image](/image/Schoolbag.png)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"): The item in the second slot gets charged when the first one is full. Overcharges on the first item also jump to the second one.
* [![image](/image/Unicorn_Stump.png)](/wiki/Unicorn_Stump "Unicorn Stump") [Unicorn Stump](/wiki/Unicorn_Stump "Unicorn Stump") + [![image](/image/Sacrificial_Dagger.png)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Dagger "Sacrificial Dagger") [Sacrificial Dagger](/wiki/Sacrificial_Dagger "Sacrificial Dagger"): In most boss fights, charges are regenerated faster than invincibility wears of.
* [![image](/image/White_Pony.png)](/wiki/White_Pony "White Pony") [White Pony](/wiki/White_Pony "White Pony"): Since the beam trail from the charge attack deals so much damage, if used on a boss with a high amount of health, 4.5 Volt will often completely recharge the item after each use allowing for repeated usage while the boss is still alive.


Interactions
--------------


* Does not charge items which gain charge over time by default. (e.g. [![image](/image/Sharp_Straw.png)](/wiki/Sharp_Straw "Sharp Straw") [Sharp Straw](/wiki/Sharp_Straw "Sharp Straw"), [![image](/image/The_Candle.png)](/wiki/The_Candle "The Candle") [The Candle](/wiki/The_Candle "The Candle"), [![image](/image/Butter_Bean.png)](/wiki/Butter_Bean "Butter Bean") [Butter Bean](/wiki/Butter_Bean "Butter Bean") etc.)
	+ Items converted to charge-over-time by [![image](/image/9_Volt.png)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") are not affected and may gain charge in both ways.
* [![image](/image/Alabaster_Box.png)](/wiki/Alabaster_Box "Alabaster Box") [Alabaster Box](/wiki/Alabaster_Box "Alabaster Box"): No effect. It still must be charged with Soul Hearts.
* [(Dim Bulb)](/wiki/Dim_Bulb "Dim Bulb") [Dim Bulb](/wiki/Dim_Bulb "Dim Bulb"): Does not deactivate until the first charge bar is completely filled. A partial charge of the first bar will retain Dim Bulb's bonus.
