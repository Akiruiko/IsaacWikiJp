 # 4.5 Volt ![image](/image/4.5_Volt.png) 


Effects
---------


* Tears now have a random chance to apply a [shrinking](/wiki/Status_Effects#Effects "Status Effects") effect, causing enemies to shrink in size and also run away from Isaac.
	+ Shrunk enemies can be crushed and killed by walking over them.
* The shrinking effect lasts 5 seconds.
* This item belongs to the [Fun Guy](/wiki/Fun_Guy "Fun Guy") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a walking mushroom.


Notes
-------


* The shrinking effect does not affect bosses or mini-bosses.
* Any enemies that are spawned from the death of a shrunken enemy do not carry over the shrunken effect.
* [Champions](/wiki/Champion "Champion") and enemies that explode upon death will damage Isaac if crushed.
* Shrinking a [Heart](/wiki/Mask_%2B_Heart "Mask + Heart") monster will cause its corresponding Mask to shrink as well. The Mask can be crushed and killed separately.
* The chance to fire a shrinking tear does not scale with [Luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").
