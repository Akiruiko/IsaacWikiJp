 # Whore of Babylon ![image](/image/Whore_of_Babylon.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants +1.5 [Damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") and +0.3 [Speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") whenever Isaac has half a Red Heart or less.


Notes
-------


* [(Eve)](/wiki/Eve "Eve") [Eve](/wiki/Eve "Eve") starts with this item by default, and has the following extra effects:
	+ The item is activated at one full Red Heart or less.
	+ Her damage multiplier increases from 0.75 to 1.0 when active.
* The effect is removed after leaving a room with more than half a heart (more than one full heart for  [(Eve)](/wiki/Eve "Eve") [Eve](/wiki/Eve "Eve")).
* The effect may not be immediately applied if Isaac has lost red hearts without taking damage; the effect will activate upon entering a new room.
* The effect is always active for characters without heart containers, such as  [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)") and  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"), though other characters can also lose their heart containers through Devil deals or items like [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Paw.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") [Guppy's Paw](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") or [![image](/image/Abaddon.png)](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") [Abaddon](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon").
	+ (Added in Repentance) This also includes  [(Tainted Jacob)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") [Tainted Jacob](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") after being hit by Dark Esau.
* [(III - The Empress)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "III - The Empress") [III - The Empress](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") grants a similar effect to Whore of Babylon for the current room which does stack with Whore of Babylon.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Stacking *The Empress* on Whore of Babylon either via multiple cards or multiple activations of [![image](/image/Blank_Card.png)](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") [Blank Card](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") increases damage by the number of uses *squared*, e.g. +1.5 * 2 * 2 total damage bonus for using the card on top of activated Whore of Babylon.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth) [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper"): As Keeper cannot have half of a Coin Heart, this item has no effect on him.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Rotten Heart)](/wiki/Rotten_Heart "Rotten Heart") [Rotten Hearts](/wiki/Rotten_Heart "Rotten Heart"): Counts as a full Red Heart for the purposes of this item, rendering it impossible to activate (except for  [(Eve)](/wiki/Eve "Eve") [Eve](/wiki/Eve "Eve")).
* [![image](/image/Whore_of_Babylon.png)](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") Whore of Babylon: No further effect when multiple copies are acquired.
