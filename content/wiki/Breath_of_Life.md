 # Breath of Life ![image](/image/Breath_of_Life.png) 


Effect
--------


* Spawns a floating finger [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that can be aimed with the fire buttons in all directions.
	+ The finger fires invisible [spectral](/wiki/Spectral "Spectral") lasers, doing 10% of Isaac's [Damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage"). The lasers fire 10 times per second and is not affected by Isaac's tear rate.
	+ The laser has thickness based on Isaac Damage, making it easier to inflict damage on higher Damage.
	+ While not being aimed with the fire buttons, the finger points in the direction of movement or downwards if standing still.
* (Removed in Repentance) The Finger!'s lasers can apply Isaac's [Tear effects](/wiki/Tear_effects "Tear effects"), which makes status effects trigger very often.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The Finger!'s lasers does not apply Isaac's [Tear effects](/wiki/Tear_effects "Tear effects").
