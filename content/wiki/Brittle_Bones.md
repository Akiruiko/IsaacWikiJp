Effects
---------


* Grants 6 empty [(Bone Heart)](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart") [Bone Hearts](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart").
* Removes all [Red Heart containers](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health"). Does not remove existing Bone Hearts, but does empty them.
* Upon losing a Bone Heart, including ones acquired from other sources, Isaac fires a ring of 8 bones that split into more bones and gains a permanent +0.5 [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears") up.
	+ Each bone does twice Isaac's damage plus a flat 22 damage; split bones do half this amount.
