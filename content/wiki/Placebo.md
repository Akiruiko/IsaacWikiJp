Effect[]
--------


* Upon use, replaces every item in the current [room](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms") (not [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") or [trinkets](/wiki/Trinkets "Trinkets")) with other random items corresponding to the current room's [item pool](/wiki/Item_Pool "Item Pool").


Notes[]
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) The D6 is a [special item](/wiki/Special_item "Special item").
* [(Isaac)](/wiki/Isaac "Isaac") [Isaac](/wiki/Isaac "Isaac") starts with this item once it is unlocked.
* Since it re-rolls every item in the room, it can be more efficient to use it in rooms where multiple items are in the same room. For instance:
	+ In the (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop"), when multiple items are available for purchase.
	+ In the (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room"), when there are multiple deals offered.
	+ In the (Boss Room) [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_Room "Boss Room") after the [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom") fight, where both [(The Polaroid)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") and [(The Negative)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") can be rerolled, at the cost of the opportunity to go to the [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)")/[(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room"). Once one item is picked up the other will disappear.
	+ In the (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") Room, where all 4 items can be rerolled at once.
	+ When [(There's Options)](/wiki/There%27s_Options "There's Options") [There's Options](/wiki/There%27s_Options "There's Options") or (Added in Afterbirth)[(More Options)](/wiki/More_Options "More Options") [More Options](/wiki/More_Options "More Options") spawn two items.
* Items from [chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests") can be rerolled.
* When an item pool is exhausted, every item will be rerolled to [(Breakfast)](/wiki/Breakfast "Breakfast") [Breakfast](/wiki/Breakfast "Breakfast").
* If Isaac runs out of red hearts in the (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room"), then rerolls, the prices of the items switch over to soul hearts.
* Using the D6 on an active item yields different rerolls depending on whether you picked up the active item first.
* Using the D6 to reroll items duplicated with (Added in Afterbirth)[(Diplopia)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") will reroll all the items into different items. The copied item will not be rerolled into the same one as the original item.
* With [(Sharp Plug)](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug") [Sharp Plug](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug") and any combination of items that can infinitely regenerate health, the D6 can be used to reroll items indefinitely.
* Be careful when rerolling, as it will replace the item with another item from the **current** room's item pool. This can be used as an advantage in various ways; for example, after defeating [The Fallen](/wiki/The_Fallen "The Fallen"), the item will be drawn from the [Devil Room item pool](/wiki/Devil_Room_(Item_Pool) "Devil Room (Item Pool)"), so Isaac can safely roll the item into another from that pool. This behavior can also be an advantage in (Angel Room) [Angel Rooms](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") since [(Key Piece 1)](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1") [Key Piece 1](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1") and [(Key Piece 2)](/wiki/Key_Piece_2 "Key Piece 2") [Key Piece 2](/wiki/Key_Piece_2 "Key Piece 2") can be rerolled to get a free Angel Room item.

* (Added in Repentance)[(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a white wisp in the middle ring. An extra wisp is spawned per item rerolled.
