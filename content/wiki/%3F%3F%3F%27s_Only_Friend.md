Effects

It can be moved using the shooting directional keys, similarly to [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") and [![image](/image/Robo-Baby_2.0.png)](/wiki/Robo-Baby_2.0 "Robo-Baby 2.0") [Robo-Baby 2.0](/wiki/Robo-Baby_2.0 "Robo-Baby 2.0").
	+ (Removed in Repentance) ???'s Only Friend deals 2.5 damage per tick, and ticks 15 times a second, dealing a total of 37.5 damage per second.
		- (Added in Repentance) ???'s Only Friend deals 3.5 damage per tick, and ticks slower.
* This item belongs to the [Beelzebub](/wiki/Beelzebub "Beelzebub") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a giant humanoid fly.


Notes
-------


* Unlike The Ludovico Technique, it cannot be controlled with the mouse, even with mouse control enabled.
* Holding two opposite fire keys (both left and right or both up and down) at the same time will keep the familiar in place, while making Isaac fire in the direction of whichever fire key was pressed second.
	+ This can help during combats with bosses who do not move a lot, as the familiar can continuously damage the boss when kept stationary.
	+ On some keyboards, holding opposite fire keys may cause other keys to become unresponsive.
