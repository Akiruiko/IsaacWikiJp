Notes
-------


* This item is a guaranteed drop from [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom") alongside [![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid"), provided they are unlocked. However, they are mutually exclusive: Once one of them is picked up, the other one will disappear.
	+ With the use of a teleportation item and either a 5 pip [Dice Room](/wiki/Dice_Room "Dice Room") or a [![image](/image/Forget_Me_Now.png)](/wiki/Forget_Me_Now "Forget Me Now") [Forget Me Now](/wiki/Forget_Me_Now "Forget Me Now"), both The Polaroid and The Negative or multiple copies of The Polaroid or The Negative can be obtained.
	+ With (Added in Repentance) [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"), proper alignment of both characters can enable picking up both The Polaroid and The Negative.
* The Negative always triggers when taking damage as characters who lack heart containers, such as  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") and  [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") (by default),  [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)") and  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") (permanently), (Added in Repentance) [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") and  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") (permanently)  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") (only as the soul),  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") (permanently),  [(Dead Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus") [Dead Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus")(by default),  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") (permanently) or any other character who has chosen to trade away their heart containers in [deals with the Devil](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room"), [Black Markets](/wiki/Black_Market "Black Market"), or with [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Paw.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") [Guppy's Paw](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") or (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Potato_Peeler.png)](/wiki/Potato_Peeler "Potato Peeler") [Potato Peeler](/wiki/Potato_Peeler "Potato Peeler").
* The Negative will be the rightmost item after defeating Mom, in case [Curse of the Blind](/wiki/Curse_of_the_Blind "Curse of the Blind") is active.
* It is possible to obtain two Negatives by obtaining one as an  [(Eden)](/wiki/Eden "Eden") [Eden](/wiki/Eden "Eden") starting item.
* Obtaining multiple copies of The Negative does not cause its effect to stack.
* As with all items crucial to story progress ([![image](/image/Key_Piece_1.png)](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1") [Key Piece 1](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1") and [![image](/image/Key_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Key_Piece_2 "Key Piece 2") [Key Piece 2](/wiki/Key_Piece_2 "Key Piece 2"), (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Knife_Piece_1.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") [Knife Piece 1](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") and (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Knife_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2"), (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Dad%27s_Note.png)](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note") [Dad's Note](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note"), and (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Dogma_(Item).png)](/wiki/Dogma_(Item) "Dogma") [Dogma](/wiki/Dogma_(Item) "Dogma (Item)")), this item has protection from full-run rerolls. It does not, however, share the immunity (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Dad%27s_Note.png)](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note") [Dad's Note](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note") has to D6-type rerolls and (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void").
