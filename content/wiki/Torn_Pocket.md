 # Torn Pocket ![image](/image/Torn_Pocket.png) 

Effects
---------


* Upon taking damage, Isaac drops 2 random [Pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") from his inventory (except [Hearts](/wiki/Hearts "Hearts"), [Pills](/wiki/Pills "Pills"), or [Cards](/wiki/Cards "Cards")).


Notes
-------


* All pickups are subjected to standard pickup spawn rules, which means that trinket's effect won't necessarily result in a net neutral.
	+ [Coins](/wiki/Coins "Coins") dropped have a chance of being replaced with Golden Pennies, Lucky Pennies, Nickels, Sticky Nickels or Dimes.
	+ [Bombs](/wiki/Bombs "Bombs") dropped have a chance of being replaced with double Bombs, Golden Bombs, Troll Bombs or Megatroll Bombs.
		- When a dropped bomb is replaced with a Troll/Megatroll bomb, the game will still subtract that bomb from the total bomb count.
		- Giga bombs, however, can't be dropped if Isaac has them, but their count will still be retained unless the bomb count reaches 0.
	+ [Keys](/wiki/Keys "Keys") dropped have a chance of being replaced with Golden Keys or Charged Keys.
