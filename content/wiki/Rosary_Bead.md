 # Rosary Bead ![image](/image/Rosary_Bead.png) 

Effects
---------


* Increases the chance to have an (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") replace a (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room"), from 50% (base chance) to 75%.
* Increases the chance to find [(The Bible)](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") [The Bible](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") to 45% in the (Library) [Library](/wiki/Library "Library") and in the (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop") to 13%.


Notes
-------


* The increased chance will not provide an Angel Room on Basement II. And as of *Repentance*, due to an Angel Room being guaranteed after skipping the first Devil Deal, Rosary Bead only increases in usefulness after the first Angel Room has been encountered.


* If a Devil Deal or (Removed in Repentance) (Black Market) [Black Market](/wiki/Black_Market "Black Market") deal has been paid, an Angel Room will not spawn, even with Rosary Bead.
* This item does not increase the chance for an Angel/Devil Room Door to spawn when a Boss is killed, unlike [(Goat Head)](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head") [Goat Head](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head") or [(The Book of Belial)](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") [The Book of Belial](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial").
