 # Mother's Kiss ![image](/image/Mother%27s_Kiss.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants one [heart container](/wiki/Hearts#Red_Heart_Containers "Hearts") while held.
	+ This heart container will be filled the first time the trinket is picked up.


Notes
-------


* If the only heart container Isaac has is the one given by Mother's Kiss, the trinket will be destroyed if the heart container is traded/consumed.
	+ The trinket will get destroyed even if smelted via [(Smelter)](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter"), [(Marbles)](/wiki/Marbles "Marbles") [Marbles](/wiki/Marbles "Marbles"), or a [Gulp! pill](/wiki/Pills "Pills").
* If Isaac drops the trinket while he only has one heart container for health, he will have no health and die instantly.
	+ This also means that using [(0 - The Fool?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "0 - The Fool?") [0 - The Fool?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") card will do the same, even if he has soul hearts.
* The extra red heart container can exceed the maximum coin heart container limit of  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"), allowing them to obtain more than 3 or 2 [coin hearts](/wiki/Health#Coin_Hearts "Health"), respectively.
* The heart added is a soul heart for  [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)") and  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany"), and a black heart for  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") and  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas").
	+ Using The Fool? card as one of these characters while holding this item will kill you instantly, as it drops the trinket, removing the last half soul heart that you normally would remain with.
* [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") will always get a [(Bone Heart)](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart") [Bone Heart](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart") regardless of whether the body or the soul picked up the trinket.


Synergies
-----------


* [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)") /  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") /  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") /  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") /  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") /  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"): If Mother's Kiss is picked up while having 12 Soul/Black Hearts, Mother's Kiss will not trigger until damage is taken. However, if only half a heart of damage is taken, Mother's Kiss will immediately restore the health back to a full 12 but believe its effect failed due to not restoring a full heart's worth, allowing it to trigger again and again until a full heart of damage is taken, after which it will cease taking effect. If combined with [(The Wafer)](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer") [The Wafer](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer"), this makes any of the aforementioned 6 characters virtually invincible as long as their health is not reduced in any way through Devil Deals, Health Down pills, etc.[[1]](#cite_note-1)
* [(Golden Trinket)](/wiki/Golden_Trinket "Golden Trinket") [Golden Trinket](/wiki/Golden_Trinket "Golden Trinket") / [(Mom's Box)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box") [Mom's Box](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box"): Adds 2 heart containers.
* [(Guppy's Paw)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") [Guppy's Paw](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw"): The trinket will be consumed, but the soul hearts from conversion are kept.
* [(Potato Peeler)](/wiki/Potato_Peeler "Potato Peeler") [Potato Peeler](/wiki/Potato_Peeler "Potato Peeler"): The trinket will be consumed, but the damage and [(Cube of Meat)](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") [Cube of Meat](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") is kept.
