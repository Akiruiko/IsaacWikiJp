 # Eraser ![image](/image/Eraser.png) 

Effects
---------


* On use, Isaac holds an Eraser above his head, which can be thrown in any cardinal direction. Upon hitting a [monster](/wiki/Monster "Monster"), the monster will be "erased", preventing it from appearing for the rest of the run.
	+ Deals 15 damage to [bosses](/wiki/Boss "Boss"). If fatal, erases the boss for the rest of the run.
* Can only be recharged by entering a new floor. Batteries and most other methods of recharging have no effect.


Notes
-------


* Erased enemies and bosses appear as a brief pink puff of smoke. Any on-death effects are not checked.
	+ The [Seven Deadly Sins](/wiki/Seven_Deadly_Sins "Seven Deadly Sins") minibosses and [Angels](/wiki/Angel "Angel") will still drop their respective pickups or items.
	+ If used on multistage bosses like Hush or Ultra Greed, erasing the first phase skips any further phases.
* Has no effect on invincible enemies, such as [(Stone Grimace)](/wiki/Stone_Grimace "Stone Grimace") [Stone Grimaces](/wiki/Stone_Grimace "Stone Grimace"), lowered [(Host)](/wiki/Host "Host") [Hosts](/wiki/Host "Host"), or [(Eternal Fly)](/wiki/Fly#Eternal_Fly "Eternal Fly") [Eternal Flys](/wiki/Fly#Eternal_Fly "Fly").
* [(Bulb)](/wiki/Sucker#Bulb "Bulb") [Bulbs](/wiki/Sucker#Bulb "Sucker") can steal charges from the Eraser.
* Erased enemies and bosses will remain erased if a [Victory Lap](/wiki/Victory_Lap "Victory Lap") is started.
	+ Erased enemies and bosses will also remain erased if items such as [![image](/image/R_Key.png)](/wiki/R_Key "R Key") [R Key](/wiki/R_Key "R Key") or [![image](/image/Genesis.png)](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") [Genesis](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") are used.
* Entities such as [Ultra Greed Coins](/wiki/Ultra_Greed_Coin "Ultra Greed Coin") or [![image](/image/Little_Horn_(Item).png)](/wiki/Little_Horn "Little Horn") [Little Horn](/wiki/Little_Horn "Little Horn")'s [(Dark Ball)](/wiki/Dark_Ball "Dark Ball") [Dark Balls](/wiki/Dark_Ball "Dark Ball") are considered enemies and can be erased.
* It is possible to erase [(Charger)](/wiki/Maggot#Charger "Charger") [Chargers](/wiki/Maggot#Charger "Maggot"), rendering [(Chubber)](/wiki/Vis#Chubber "Chubber") [Chubbers](/wiki/Vis#Chubber "Vis") unable to attack.
* Erasing [(Polty)](/wiki/Polty "Polty") [Poltys](/wiki/Polty "Polty") will render [(Haunted Chest)](/wiki/Haunted_Chest "Haunted Chest") [Haunted Chests](/wiki/Haunted_Chest "Haunted Chest") harmless, but may make some rooms impossible to complete without bombs or flight as they rely on a Polty clearing a path.
* Each floor traveled up during the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent") will recharge the Eraser.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Angelic_Prism.png)](/wiki/Angelic_Prism "Angelic Prism") [Angelic Prism](/wiki/Angelic_Prism "Angelic Prism"): Throwing the Eraser through the Angelic Prism will cause it to split into four.

* [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") /  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany"): Soul and blood charges can be used with the Eraser, allowing multiple uses per floor.
* [![image](/image/Blood_Puppy.png)](/wiki/Blood_Puppy "Blood Puppy") [Blood Puppy](/wiki/Blood_Puppy "Blood Puppy"): Throwing the Eraser at an enraged Blood Puppy (second stage) will 'erase' its enraged form, keeping it permanently tame.
	+ Throwing the Eraser at its third stage will make it cycle through its normal and second stage as it kills enemies.
* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a pink eraser wisp on the middle ring. The wisp is immune to projectiles. If a [non-boss enemy](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters") touches the wisp, it is erased and the wisp is destroyed. The wisp cannot erase [bosses](/wiki/Bosses "Bosses"), regardless of how much health they have left.
* [![image](/image/Glowing_Hour_Glass.png)](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass") [Glowing Hour Glass](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass"): Using Glowing Hour Glass to return to the previous floor will keep the charge Eraser received from entering the next floor.

Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/9_Volt.png)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") / [![image](/image/Battery_Pack.png)](/wiki/Battery_Pack "Battery Pack") [Battery Pack](/wiki/Battery_Pack "Battery Pack"): Item doesn't fully charge the Eraser when picked up.

* [![image](/image/My_Shadow.png)](/wiki/My_Shadow "My Shadow") [My Shadow](/wiki/My_Shadow "My Shadow"): Erasing a [(Charger)](/wiki/Maggot#Charger "Charger") [Charger](/wiki/Maggot#Charger "Maggot") will prevent all newly created [friendly](/wiki/Friendly "Friendly") Chargers from spawning, rendering the item useless.

* [![image](/image/Number_One.png)](/wiki/Number_One "Number One") [Number One](/wiki/Number_One "Number One"): Lowers the Eraser's range drastically, making the item much more difficult to use. Range increases do not negate this.
* [![image](/image/Sharp_Plug.png)](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug") [Sharp Plug](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug"): Attempting to recharge the Eraser with the Sharp Plug hurts Isaac for half a heart without recharging the item.
