 # Jupiter ![image](/image/Jupiter.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants two Red [Heart containers](/wiki/Heart_container "Heart container"), of which half a heart will be filled.
* -0.3 [Speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed").
* Standing still causes Isaac to build up [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") at a rate of +0.25 per second, up to a +0.5 speed bonus.
* Isaac charges up while standing still. Moving releases a fart cloud behind Isaac, damaging and inflicting [Poison](/wiki/Status_Effects "Status Effects") on enemies that pass through it and draining the speed buff at a rate of -0.25 speed per second. The fart clouds are left behind for the duration of the speed buff.
	+ The fart clouds deal 0.5x Isaac's damage per tick (1.5x Isaac's damage per second), and last ~2.5 seconds.
* Isaac is immune to Poison from enemies, such as [Gasbag](/wiki/Gasbag "Gasbag").


Notes
-------


* As the speed buff requires Isaac to stand still, Jupiter is effectively a speed down.
* The fart clouds are mechanically independent of the speed increase. Even while at max speed, the fart cloud must be charged by standing still.
* Jupiter acts solely as a speed boost for  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") with no other effects.
