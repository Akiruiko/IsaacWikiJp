 # Pay to Win ![image](/image/Pay_to_Win.png) 

Effects
---------


* [Restock Boxes](/wiki/Restock_Box "Restock Box") always spawn in (Treasure Room) [Treasure Rooms](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room").


Notes
-------


* The trinket's effect applies when the floor is generated, so it will only take effect if already held when entering a new floor. This means that finding it on a floor will not change the Treasure Room on that floor, nor will dropping it remove its effect on that floor's Treasure Room if Pay to Win was held when the floor was entered.
* This trinket does not affect the two Treasure Rooms spawned in [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)").
* In [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode"), this affects both normal and silver types of Treasure Rooms.
* (Added in Repentance) When brought to the alternate path floors, there seems to be a high chance of the treasure room having one extra item available to be picked up alongside the usual choice of two items.
