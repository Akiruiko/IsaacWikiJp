 # Pinky Eye ![image](/image/Pinky_Eye.png) 

Effects
---------


* Adds a 10% chance to shoot a [poison tear](/wiki/Effects#Poison_Tears "Effects"), dealing damage over time when inflicted.
* The activation chance depends on the [Luck](/wiki/Attributes#Luck "Attributes") stat. The activation rate is equal to 1/(10 - (Luck / 2)). At base luck (0), the chance is 10%, maxing out at 100% at 18 luck.
	+ Due to how this formula works, increases in activation rate are only seen with every 2 points of luck, as this formula rounds down after dividing Isaac's luck by 2.


Interactions
--------------


* [(The Common Cold)](/wiki/The_Common_Cold "The Common Cold") [The Common Cold](/wiki/The_Common_Cold "The Common Cold"): Activation rates are individually applied to each tear, effectively allowing for higher amounts of poison tears. However at 12 Luck, this trinket will not do anything for Isaac as The Common Cold is guaranteed to make every tear poisoned at that point.
