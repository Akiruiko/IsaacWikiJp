 # Rock Bottom ![image](/image/Rock_Bottom.png) 

Effects
---------


* Upon pickup and from then onwards, locks [attributes](/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") to their highest values reached.
	+ This applies to everything that alters Isaac's attributes, including temporary buffs from activated items and pickups. This also makes him immune to any stat downgrades.


Notes
-------


* Health downs do not count as stat downgrades for Rock Bottom.
* Isaac's stats are still calculated normally behind the scenes, only their effective values are locked to their highest point. This means picking up an item such as [![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") with a severe damage penalty will make it difficult to reach a higher damage stat.
	+ For example, using [![image](/image/The_Book_of_Belial.png)](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") [The Book of Belial](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") to gain +2 damage will stay in effect indefinitely, but while it's not currently activated, Isaac must earn more than +2 damage from other items to see a difference.
	+ To best utilize Rock Bottom, the player should gain as much of a single stat as they can in a single room. For example, if a player finds a Strength card and a Devil card, using them in the same room will provide a larger permanent damage boost then if they were used in separate rooms.
	+ If the player finds an item that lowers a stat, such as Soy Milk, it may be beneficial to not take the item immediately. Instead, it's best to explore the floor for any potential damage ups, then take the stat-lowering item.
* If Rock Bottom is removed, Isaac's stats will no longer be locked, and return to match his current items/effects.

The damage and tear multipliers will still affect future stat ups.
* [(Azazel's Stump)](/wiki/Azazel%27s_Stump "Azazel's Stump") [Azazel's Stump](/wiki/Azazel%27s_Stump "Azazel's Stump"): Isaac will keep Azazel’s base stats after transforming back. This includes 1.25 base speed, +0.5 tears per second, and a 1.5x damage multiplier. The tear delay multiplier will not be given, including while Isaac is Azazel.
* [![image](/image/Berserk!.png)](/wiki/Berserk! "Berserk!") [Berserk!](/wiki/Berserk! "Berserk!") +3 flat damage and +0.4 speed last indefinitely. Will also give a tears up if (½ tears fired per second + 2), unless Isaac’s tears fired per second is already 4 or higher.
* [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") / [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") / [![image](/image/Monstro%27s_Lung.png)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"): Charged shot can be fired at Isaac’s normal fire rate.
* [(VII - The Chariot?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "VII - The Chariot?") [VII - The Chariot?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Permanently gives Isaac a gigantic tears up.
* [![image](/image/Clicker.png)](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker") [Clicker](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker"): will keep stat bonuses from items removed, and will retain the best stats of all characters that are cycled through.
* [![image](/image/D8.png)](/wiki/D8 "D8") [D8](/wiki/D8 "D8") / [(Cracked Dice)](/wiki/Cracked_Dice "Cracked Dice") [Cracked Dice](/wiki/Cracked_Dice "Cracked Dice"): Only the highest multipliers received from the D8 will be applied to Isaac. With repeated use, a 1.5-2x stat multiplier can be applied to Isaac’s speed, tears, range, and damage.
* [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") /  [![image](/image/The_Soul.png)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)"): Allows transfer of stat-ups between the two. For example, collecting Ipecac as The Forgotten doesn't give him the +40 damage boost, but it does give it to The Soul. Switching to the Soul, then switching back to the Forgotten prevents him from losing the +40 damage.
* [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Gives Isaac a massive damage up without the tears down.
	+ [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") + [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") / [![image](/image/Tech_X.png)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): If Ipecac is taken before Brimstone / Tech X, its full damage up is applied to the beam/ring properly, but if the order of the items is reversed, Ipecac will only give +2 damage.
* [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") /  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus"): Only the character that has Rock Bottom will be immune to stat downgrades.
* [![image](/image/Jupiter.png)](/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") [Jupiter](/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter"): The +0.5 speed boost becomes permanent, turning Jupiter into a +0.2 speed up. Farts made while moving still must be charged by standing still.
* [![image](/image/Kidney_Stone.png)](/wiki/Kidney_Stone "Kidney Stone") [Kidney Stone](/wiki/Kidney_Stone "Kidney Stone"): Permanently gives Isaac a x6 fire rate multiplier after firing a kidney stone. Accuracy penalty from firing kidney stones is unaffected.
* [![image](/image/Libra.png)](/wiki/Libra "Libra") [Libra](/wiki/Libra "Libra"): Stat balancing applies after Rock Bottom.
* [![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): Gives Isaac the full tears up while keeping his previous damage; however, Soy Milk's damage divider still applies to any future damage increases.
