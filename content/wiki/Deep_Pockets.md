Effects[]
---------


* Spawns a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that can be launched in the direction the player is firing after a short charge-up period.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) At full charge, it'll initially deal 6 damage per tick or 90 damage per second, but quickly drops towards 0 the slower the familiar moves.
	+ (Added in Repentance) No longer deals damage per tick, instead deals a fix amount of damage depending on charge level, at lowest being ~5 and at max being ~20.
* It bounces off walls multiple times, much like [Gurdy Jr.](/wiki/Gurdy_Jr. "Gurdy Jr.").
	+ (Added in Repentance) It will also bounce off enemies.
