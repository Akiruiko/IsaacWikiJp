 # The Left Hand ![image](/image/The_Left_Hand.png) 

Effects
---------


* Replaces all types of [Chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest") with [Red Chests](/wiki/Red_Chest "Red Chest").


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) The effect includes Chests already spawned. Entering a room that previously contained other types of Chests while holding The Left Hand will turn them into Red Chests permanently.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Chests that have already spawned are not converted into Red Chests.
* It is advised to drop The Left Hand (by holding either *CTRL* key for few seconds, holding R2 or RT for 3 seconds on PS4 and Vita and Xbox One, respectively, or holding ZR on the New Nintendo 3DS / Nintendo Switch for a few seconds) before entering [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)"), as non-Red Chests always contain item pedestals on this floor, especially the 4 located in the starting room.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Isaac may prefer Red Chests for their possible [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") or Red Chest items, at the expense of guaranteed items.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Golden Chests converted in [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)")'s starting room will contain Devil Deals, potentially allowing for more powerful items, but at the cost of Hearts.
		- Red Chests found past the starting rooms of either [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)") or [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") will contain regular Red Chest drops. Dropping the trinket before leaving the starting room is advised.
* (Added in Repentance) [Stone Chests](/wiki/Stone_Chest "Stone Chest") are affected by The Left Hand. [Old Chests](/wiki/Old_Chest "Old Chest") and [Mega Chests](/wiki/Mega_Chest "Mega Chest") are not affected.


Interactions

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Gilded_Key.png)](/wiki/Gilded_Key "Gilded Key") [Gilded Key](/wiki/Gilded_Key "Gilded Key"): Overridden by The Left Hand.
