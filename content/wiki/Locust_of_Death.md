 # Locust of Death ![image](/image/Locust_of_Death.png) 

Effects
---------


* Upon entering a room with enemies, spawns a [Black Locust](/wiki/Familiars#Locusts "Familiars") that deals quadruple Isaac's damage, applied as two hits of double damage.


Notes
-------


* The Locust will also spawn each time a wave starts in (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush").
* The Locust will not spawn each time a wave in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode") starts.
* If the player has exited the game, the Locust will spawn upon continuing from the main menu, allowing multiple locusts to spawn for the same room by repeatedly exiting.
