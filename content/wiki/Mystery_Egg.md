 # Mystery Egg ![image](/image/Mystery_Egg.png) 


Effects
---------


* Adds a chance to fire tears that [mark](/wiki/Mark "Mark") enemies. Marked enemies will be attacked by other enemies either until it is killed or it kills all the enemies attacking it (similar to the Charmed effect).
* The tears, and hence the marked enemies, will change colour to red.
* Marked enemies will also have their movement speed reduced.


Notes
-------


* The chance to fire marking tears depends on the [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck") stat. The activation rate is equal to 1/(6 - Luck). At base luck (0), the chance is 16.67%, maxing out at 100% at 4.01 luck.
* Causes pathing issues with segmented bosses, as they attempt to attack their own segments.
* Most enemies will ignore Isaac in order to attack a marked enemy, making Rotten Tomato an item with both offensive and defensive applications.
* With a high enough luck stat and piercing effects, the up time of the marked effect can be enough to render some bosses harmless, such as [Ultra Pestilence](/wiki/Ultra_Pestilence "Ultra Pestilence") or [The Duke of Flies](/wiki/The_Duke_of_Flies "The Duke of Flies") who spawn a multitude of flies that it will then focus on.
* This item is very effective during [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush"). Boss enemies affected by this item will deal massive amounts of damage to each other and Isaac will be less likely to get hurt by their attacks.
