Effects[]
---------


* Spawns a random [pill](/wiki/Pill "Pill").
* Spawns a small Spewer familiar that charges up and fires different types of [creep](/wiki/Creep "Creep").
* The familiar and his creep change randomly when Isaac uses a pill.
* Possible creep includes:
	+ A line of damaging green creep that deals 0.4 damage per tick (12 damage per second).
	+ A line of slowing black creep.
	+ A line of short-lasting, damaging red creep, with a larger puddle of creep at the end that lasts longer. The creep will deal 1.2 damage per tick (36 damage per second).
	+ A short-ranged cone of damaging yellow creep that grows larger and deals more damage the further it travels. It deals 2 damage per tick at the lowest range, and increases to 15.2 damage per tick at the furthest (~6-47 damage per second, based on range).
	+ A large ring of long-lasting slowing white creep.


Notes[]
-------


* Lil Spewer always starts with green creep.
