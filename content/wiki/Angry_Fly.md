Effects[]
---------


* At the beginning of each floor, spawns 2 portals that each lead to either the [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_Room "Boss Room"), [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room"), or [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room").
	+ The Boss Room portal is red, the Treasure Room portal is yellow, and the Secret Room portal is blue.
	+ From Chapter 4 onward, only 1 portal will spawn.
* The portals will disappear once the starting room is left, whether a portal was taken or not.


Notes[]
-------


* During the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent"), the portal will spawn in the "starting room" that leads to the next floor.
* Entering the starting room in the [Mirrored world](/wiki/Mirrored_world "Mirrored world") will cause the portals to spawn there, leading to the mirror's treasure, secret, or boss room.
* If the run is exited, the portals will not be there upon continuing.
* In [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") the boss portal will lead to a random boss, not necessarily [Delirium](/wiki/Delirium "Delirium").
* Entering a portal with Curse of the Maze active on the current floor has a chance of teleporting Isaac to a random room instead.
* The Treasure Room portal will not lead to a [Planetarium](/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium") if available, unlike [(XVII - The Stars)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XVII - The Stars") [XVII - The Stars](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes").
