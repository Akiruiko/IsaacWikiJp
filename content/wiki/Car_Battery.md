* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Sulfur.png)](/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur") [Sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur"): Will count as giving double Brimstone, giving extra damage and a x1.2 damage multiplier for the current room.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): Doubles effects of all absorbed activated items. Absorbing passives will not give extra stat ups.
* [![image](/image/Wooden_Nickel.png)](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel") [Wooden Nickel](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel"): 25% chance to spawn nothing, 50% chance to spawn one coin, and 25% chance to spawn two coins.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Berserk!.png)](/wiki/Berserk! "Berserk!") [Berserk!](/wiki/Berserk! "Berserk!"): Will only increase rage duration if no enemies are killed in the first half, effectively only affecting bosses that can't spawn enemies.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Doubles the spawned wisps on activation.
* [![image](/image/Book_of_Secrets.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Secrets "Book of Secrets") [Book of Secrets](/wiki/Book_of_Secrets "Book of Secrets"): Activates twice, (Removed in Repentance) but has a chance to uselessly activate the same effect twice.
* [![image](/image/Book_of_Shadows.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Shadows "Book of Shadows") [Book of Shadows](/wiki/Book_of_Shadows "Book of Shadows")/[![image](/image/The_Gamekid.png)](/wiki/The_Gamekid "The Gamekid") [The Gamekid](/wiki/The_Gamekid "The Gamekid")/[![image](/image/My_Little_Unicorn.png)](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn") [My Little Unicorn](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn")/[![image](/image/Unicorn_Stump.png)](/wiki/Unicorn_Stump "Unicorn Stump") [Unicorn Stump](/wiki/Unicorn_Stump "Unicorn Stump"): Doubles the length of invincibility, but no effect on damage where applicable.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Clicker.png)](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker") [Clicker](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker"): If the Car Battery is removed by the first activation, a second activation will not happen. Two activations in a row is mostly detrimental, removing two items and possibly cycling through a character that lowers health.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spindown_Dice.png)](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") [Spindown Dice](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice"): Lowers ID by 2, good for some items, bad for others.

	+ (Added in Repentance) As items are returned back into the item pool when re-rolled, the item pools aren't exhausted at all. In addition, you need to actively be holding a transformation's respective items to retain them now, so using the double re-roll to gain multiple transformations is no longer possible.
* [![image](/image/The_D6.png)](/wiki/The_D6 "The D6") [The D6](/wiki/The_D6 "The D6")/[![image](/image/D8.png)](/wiki/D8 "D8") [D8](/wiki/D8 "D8")/[![image](/image/D12.png)](/wiki/D12 "D12") [D12](/wiki/D12 "D12")/[![image](/image/D20.png)](/wiki/D20 "D20") [D20](/wiki/D20 "D20"): Re-rolls twice instantly without any benefits. (Removed in Repentance) The D6 depletes item pools at double the speed.

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Eternal_D6.png)](/wiki/Eternal_D6 "Eternal D6") [Eternal D6](/wiki/Eternal_D6 "Eternal D6"): Re-rolls twice like The D6 (see above), but the 30% chance of the item disappearing is increased to 51%.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Everything_Jar.png)](/wiki/Everything_Jar "Everything Jar") [Everything Jar](/wiki/Everything_Jar "Everything Jar"): Instead of doubling its effect, Everything Jar will spawn a poop alongside its normal drop.
* [![image](/image/Head_of_Krampus.png)](/wiki/Head_of_Krampus "Head of Krampus") [Head of Krampus](/wiki/Head_of_Krampus "Head of Krampus"): Doubles the damage the brimstone beams deal (for a total of (Removed in Repentance)880 damage/ (Added in Repentance)380 damage per use).

	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) This has been changed to spawn two Movable TNT barrels instead, which you can detonate at will.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Moving_Box.png)](/wiki/Moving_Box "Moving Box") [Moving Box](/wiki/Moving_Box "Moving Box"): Activation swaps the contents of the box with the contents of the room.
* [![image](/image/Spider_Butt.png)](/wiki/Spider_Butt "Spider Butt") [Spider Butt](/wiki/Spider_Butt "Spider Butt"): Deals 10 damage to enemies twice but does not increase slow effect.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Stitches.png)](/wiki/Stitches "Stitches") [Stitches](/wiki/Stitches "Stitches"): Swaps places with Isaac twice in quick succession, rendering Stitches useless for collecting pickups & items beyond pits, rocks etc.
