Synergies
-----------


* [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)"),  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???"),  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas"),  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas"), and  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"): Decreases the chances of useless red heart drops, which these characters can't pick up.
* [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany"): Sacrifices potential healing for more charges. Usefulness depends on active item.
* [(Eve)](/wiki/Eve "Eve") [Eve](/wiki/Eve "Eve")/[![image](/image/Whore_of_Babylon.png)](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") [Whore of Babylon](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon"): Decreases the chance of useless red heart drops when trying to maintain the half a heart (full heart on Eve) of health required to keep Whore of Babylon's ability active.
* [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper")/ [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"): Nearly useless, since all hearts are converted into blue flies anyway. Only use is contributing to the Seraphim transformation.
* [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany"): Sacrifices potential blood charges for more health. Overall, still a beneficial pickup.
* [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene"): Due to the "in your face" gameplay of Tainted Maggy, soul hearts will not be as useful up until the later floors.
