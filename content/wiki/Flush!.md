 # Flush! ![image](/image/Flush!.png) 

Effects
---------


* Turns all non-boss [monsters](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters") in the [room](/wiki/Room "Room") into [poop](/wiki/Poop "Poop").
* (Added in Afterbirth) Floods the whole room with water (same effect as seen in [(Flooded Caves)](/wiki/Flooded_Caves "Flooded Caves") [Flooded Caves](/wiki/Flooded_Caves "Flooded Caves")).
	+ Floods the room with blood if used in [(Womb)](/wiki/Womb "Womb") [Womb](/wiki/Womb "Womb") and its alts.
* (Added in Afterbirth) Instantly kills most poop-themed bosses ([Dingle](/wiki/Dingle "Dingle"), [Dangle](/wiki/Dangle "Dangle"), [Brownie](/wiki/Brownie "Brownie"), (Added in Repentance) [Clog](/wiki/Clog "Clog")).
* (Added in Repentance) Extinguishes all Normal and Red [fire places](/wiki/Fire_Places "Fire Places") in the room.
* (Added in Repentance) Turns lava-filled pits on the [(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines") into rock, allowing them to be walked over.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Oh Crap](/wiki/Oh_Crap "Oh Crap") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a walking pile of poop.


Notes
-------


* Poops produced by this item act similarly to regular enemies, which causes them to flash red when hit. Certain items will also behave like the poop was a normal enemy, such as [![image](/image/BBF.png)](/wiki/BBF "BBF") [BBF](/wiki/BBF "BBF").
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) Enemies that are turned into poop act more similarly to regular poop by crumbling upon being attacked.
* If the Fear effect is applied, the poop will stay a dark red.
* Does not work against [Lil' Haunts](/wiki/Lil%27_Haunt "Lil' Haunt") when fighting [The Haunt](/wiki/The_Haunt "The Haunt").
	+ (Removed in Afterbirth) The first little haunt when fighting the Haunt can be flushed, but this softlocks the game.
* Does not work against [Mom's Hand](/wiki/Mom%27s_Hand "Mom's Hand") or [Wizoob](/wiki/Wizoob "Wizoob") enemies.
* Does not work against [Turdlings](/wiki/Turdlings "Turdlings"), (Added in Repentance) [Colostomia](/wiki/Colostomia "Colostomia") or (Added in Repentance) [Turdlet](/wiki/Turdlet "Turdlet") despite them being poop-based enemies.
* Does not work against mini-bosses.
* May not work against enemies currently jumping.
* Can freeze the game if used on Sucker Grimace (PS4)
* The drops from the poops that come from enemies aren't affected by [(Petrified Poop)](/wiki/Petrified_Poop "Petrified Poop") [Petrified Poop](/wiki/Petrified_Poop "Petrified Poop").
* Using it against the [Champion](/wiki/Champion "Champion") version of a monster will forfeit the chance to get the champion's drop.
* (Added in Afterbirth) Poop created by use of this item does not heal Isaac when he has the [Oh Crap](/wiki/Oh_Crap "Oh Crap") transformation.
* (Added in Afterbirth) When used inside a crawl space the ladders will be covered in water but the walls will not.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/120_Volt.png)](/wiki/120_Volt "120 Volt") [120 Volt](/wiki/120_Volt "120 Volt") / (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Jacob%27s_Ladder.png)](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder") [Jacob's Ladder](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder"): Since Flush floods the room with water, it is now considered a wet environment, which significantly increases the arcing distance of the electricity created by these items.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns brown wisps in the middle ring. An additional wisp is spawned for each enemy turned into [poop](/wiki/Poops "Poops").
