 # Torn Card ![image](/image/Torn_Card.png) 

Effects
---------


* Every 15 shots, Isaac will shoot an [(Ipecac)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") + [(My Reflection)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") tear with a very high range value.
* The tear will follow Isaac until it hits an enemy or lands, where it will explode.


Synergies
-----------


* [(Almond Milk)](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk") [Almond Milk](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk")/[(Soy Milk)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): Unlike the normal [(Ipecac)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") synergy, Torn Card shots ignore the damage down multiplier, always dealing +40 damage, **significantly** increasing DPS.
* [![image](/image/Brain_Worm.png)](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm") [Brain Worm](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm"): Brain Worm forces some tears to snap 90 degrees to target enemies that they may have missed.
* [(Chocolate Milk)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): Ipecac shots will always deal the same damage, regardless of charge level. Low power shots can be spammed to make use of this.
* [(Death's Touch)](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch") [Death's Touch](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch")/[(Pupula Duplex)](/wiki/Pupula_Duplex "Pupula Duplex") [Pupula Duplex](/wiki/Pupula_Duplex "Pupula Duplex"): Ipecac shots get a bigger hitbox, making shots easier to hit, and from a safer distance.
* [(Eye of the Occult)](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult") [Eye of the Occult](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult"): Tear control is stronger than the reflection, although it's still present if Isaac stops shooting. Effectively negates downside.
* [(Fire Mind)](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind") [Fire Mind](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind"): A fire is always spawned at the place of explosion.
* [Homing](/wiki/Tear_Effects "Tear Effects"): The homing is stronger than the reflection, effectively negating Torn Card's downside.
* [![image](/image/Hook_Worm.png)](/wiki/Hook_Worm "Hook Worm") [Hook Worm](/wiki/Hook_Worm "Hook Worm"): Hook Worm allows tears to hit enemies more easily, while also making them easier to avoid.
* [(Lead Pencil)](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil") [Lead Pencil](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil"): Lowers tear shot requirement by 1. Lead Pencil will always proc at the 14th shot, soon followed by Torn Card's at 15th.
* [(Monstro's Lung)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"): An Ipecac shot is fired for 4 bursts consecutively, with the 5th burst lacking one, and repeat. Makes Torn Card very consistent.
* [(Proptosis)](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") [Proptosis](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis"): Ipecac tear will always explode before reflection takes effect. It's the **only item** that affects Torn Card's flat 40 damage.
* [(Spirit Sword)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword"): Swings can be spammed rapidly to create Ipecac shots.


* [(Tiny Planet)](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") [Tiny Planet](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet"): Ipecac shots will stick to the orbit and direction Isaac is aiming.
* [![image](/image/Whip_Worm.png)](/wiki/Whip_Worm "Whip Worm") [Whip Worm](/wiki/Whip_Worm "Whip Worm"): Whip Worm forces tears to fly very fast, usually preventing enemies from dodging them.


Interactions
--------------


* [(20/20)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20")/[(Eye Sore)](/wiki/Eye_Sore "Eye Sore") [Eye Sore](/wiki/Eye_Sore "Eye Sore")/[(The Inner Eye)](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") [The Inner Eye](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye")/[(Immaculate Heart)](/wiki/Immaculate_Heart "Immaculate Heart") [Immaculate Heart](/wiki/Immaculate_Heart "Immaculate Heart")/[(Loki's Horns)](/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns "Loki's Horns") [Loki's Horns](/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns "Loki's Horns")/[(Mom's Eye)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye") [Mom's Eye](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye")/[(Mutant Spider)](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") [Mutant Spider](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider")/[(The Wiz)](/wiki/The_Wiz "The Wiz") [The Wiz](/wiki/The_Wiz "The Wiz"): Extra tears fired do not count towards Torn Card proccing.


* [(Anti-Gravity)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): Ipecac shots will follow Isaac closely until he stops firing.
* [(Epic Fetus)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Despite replacing tears, Torn Card will still calculate shots required based on Isaac's fire rate. These shots will be fired regardless if the missile crosshair is moving or not.
* [(Evil Eye)](/wiki/Evil_Eye "Evil Eye") [Evil Eye](/wiki/Evil_Eye "Evil Eye"): Tears shot by evil eyes cannot fire Ipecac shots, nor count towards proccing.
* [(Fate's Reward)](/wiki/Fate%27s_Reward "Fate's Reward") [Fate's Reward](/wiki/Fate%27s_Reward "Fate's Reward"): Cannot proc Torn Card.
* [![image](/image/Found_Soul.png)](/wiki/Found_Soul "Found Soul") [Found Soul](/wiki/Found_Soul "Found Soul"): Has its own shot counter, independent of Isaac's.

* [(Incubus)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus"): Has its own shot counter, independent of Isaac's. Shots not affected by its damage multiplier, always dealing +40 damage.
* [(Lachryphagy)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Ipecac shots become Lachryphagy shots, allowing them to grow. Reflection is weaker due to lower momentum. The burst tears spawned from the tear will all explode.
* [![image](/image/Lil_Clot.png)](/wiki/Lil_Clot "Lil Clot") [Lil Clot](/wiki/Lil_Clot "Lil Clot"): Has its own shot counter, independent of Isaac's. Shots not affected by its damage multiplier, always dealing +40 damage.
* [(Marked)](/wiki/Marked "Marked") [Marked](/wiki/Marked "Marked"): Ipecac shots will be fired from cardinal directions rather than aiming at the crosshair.
* [![image](/image/Second_Hand.png)](/wiki/Second_Hand "Second Hand") [Second Hand](/wiki/Second_Hand "Second Hand"): No effect on poison.
* [(Twisted Pair)](/wiki/Twisted_Pair "Twisted Pair") [Twisted Pair](/wiki/Twisted_Pair "Twisted Pair"): Have their own shot counter, independent of Isaac's. Shots not affected by their damage multiplier, always dealing +40 damage. Both of the familiars fire an Ipecac shot at the same time.
