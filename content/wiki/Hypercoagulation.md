Effects[]
---------


* Upon use, pressing an attack direction will cause a swipe attack with high knockback and 3 damage.
	+ The swipe scales in size with Isaac's size.
	+ The swipe will appear further from Isaac the higher his [range](/wiki/Range "Range") is.
	+ The swipe can be used to open [(Spiked Chest)](/wiki/Spiked_Chest "Spiked Chest") [Spiked Chests](/wiki/Spiked_Chest "Spiked Chest") and [(Mimic Chest)](/wiki/Mimic_Chest "Mimic Chest") [Mimic Chests](/wiki/Mimic_Chest "Mimic Chest") without taking damage.
	+ The swipe can be used to block bullets.
* Swiping a [pickup](/wiki/Pickup "Pickup") on the floor will add it to the bag. The bag's contents cannot be dropped. Up to 8 pickups can be stored.
	+ Double pickups like Double Hearts will add two copies to the bag. Blended hearts will add one red heart and one soul heart.
	+ Sticky nickels can't be picked up unless unstuck.
	+ Chests and sacks can't be picked up, but can be opened with a swipe even behind obstacles.
	+ If the player has enough money to buy a pickup from a [shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop"), using Bag of Crafting on that pickup will purchase it and automatically add it to the bag.
* Once 8 pickups are held in the bag, the bag can be used once more to spawn an item pedestal.
	+ If a recipe would result in an item that hasn't yet been unlocked, a random item will be crafted instead.
* There are a total of 25 different types of consumables that can be placed in the bag. The ordering does not matter for the outcome.


**As  [(Tainted Cain)](/wiki/Tainted_Cain "Tainted Cain") [Tainted Cain](/wiki/Tainted_Cain "Tainted Cain"):**



* If pickups are collected after the max of 8 is reached, the contents shift left and up, deleting the top left slot and adding at the bottom right. Tapping the switch key cycles the bag's contents left and up in a loop, making it possible to choose which pickup to overwrite.
* Once 8 pickups are held in the bag, the bag will show a preview what would be crafted. Holding down the Use Pill/Card button will craft the item and place it directly in Tainted Cain's inventory.
	+ Crafting an activated item while already holding one will turn the old one into pickups like collecting it would.
	+ Curse of the Blind hides the crafting preview.

* [(Wild Card)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Wild Card") [Wild Card](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Holding up Bag of Crafting counts as an active item use for Wild Card, and can be replicated.
