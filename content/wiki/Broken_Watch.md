Effects[]
---------


* Every 4th newly discovered room, the Broken Watch [slows](/wiki/Slow "Slow") all enemies and their attacks down, but has a rare chance of speeding them up by 40% instead.
	+ The effect is lost upon leaving the room, and not gained again if re-entering it.


Notes[]
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Because of the slow effect, champion versions of enemies will be tinted the same color as all other enemies. This makes it much harder to distinguish certain champion types, such as those that explode upon death.
* If the slow effect triggers when entering [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") boss area, it will be active for all four horsemen and the Beast. This is also true of the speed effect.
	+ To trigger the effects of Broken Watch during the fight and do not have either the (Added in Repentance)[(Red Key)](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key") [Red Key](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key") or a (Added in Repentance)[(Cracked Key)](/wiki/Cracked_Key "Cracked Key") [Cracked Key](/wiki/Cracked_Key "Cracked Key"), you have to clear 1 room after the effect has activated, then explore every room in [(Home)](/wiki/Home "Home") [Home](/wiki/Home "Home"). Otherwise, after the effect has activated in a room, immediately go to [(Home)](/wiki/Home "Home") [Home](/wiki/Home "Home") and explore every room.


Interactions[]
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Glowing Hour Glass)](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass") [Glowing Hour Glass](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass"): The Glowing Hour Glass does not reset the entered room counter: using it in a room where the Broken Watch is active and immediately returning without visiting other new rooms will not trigger the effect again.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Lil Clot)](/wiki/Lil_Clot "Lil Clot") [Lil Clot](/wiki/Lil_Clot "Lil Clot") / (Added in Repentance)[(Sumptorium)](/wiki/Sumptorium "Sumptorium") [Sumptorium](/wiki/Sumptorium "Sumptorium") /  [(Tainted Eve)](/wiki/Tainted_Eve "Tainted Eve") [Tainted Eve](/wiki/Tainted_Eve "Tainted Eve"): Clots are moving and firing at normal speeds when a room is sped up. This can be extra hurtful as Tainted Eve, since the clots will not move in sync with her.
* (Removed in Afterbirth) [(Stop Watch)](/wiki/Stop_Watch "Stop Watch") [Stop Watch](/wiki/Stop_Watch "Stop Watch"): Overrides Broken Watch; the speed-up effect will not occur.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Both the slow effect and the rarer speed up can trigger at the start of a room.
		- (Removed in Repentance) This results in enemies being slowed to around 71.8% of their original speed.
		- (Added in Repentance) This results in enemies being sped up by 12%.
