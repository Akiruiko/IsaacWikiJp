 # A Bar of Soap ![image](/image/A_Bar_of_Soap.png) 


Effects
---------


* On use, the current [floor](/wiki/Floor "Floor") will be [completely re-generated](/wiki/Level_Generation "Level Generation") and Forget Me Now will be removed from Isaac's inventory.
	+ Isaac will restart the level as if he had entered a new floor.


Notes
-------


* The re-generated floor will count as the same floor number as the one Isaac used Forget Me Now in.
	+ If a (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") / (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") is not encountered after defeating the boss of the re-generated floor, the multiplier tied to the number of floors since the last Devil/Angel Room affecting the spawn chance will not change.
		- (Added in Repentance) If the first possible (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") is encountered, the 100% chance for the next deal to be an angel chance is preserved upon regenerating the floor.
	+ If a Devil/Angel Room is encountered before regenerating the floor, the multiplier will become x0.25 upon regenerating the floor.
* Any [items](/wiki/Items "Items") earned before using the re-generation effect will remain in Isaac's inventory.
* If used on the [(Depths)](/wiki/Depths "Depths") [Depths](/wiki/Depths "Depths") / [(Necropolis)](/wiki/Necropolis "Necropolis") [Necropolis](/wiki/Necropolis "Necropolis") / [(Dank Depths)](/wiki/Dank_Depths "Dank Depths") [Dank Depths](/wiki/Dank_Depths "Dank Depths") II after beating [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom"), both [![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") and [![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") can be obtained in one run. Additionally, two (Boss Rush) [Boss Rushes](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") can be entered as long as the total playtime of the run stays under 20 minutes.
	+ (Added in Repentance) This also allows opening the door to [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") / [(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") II in the starting room.
* (Added in Repentance) If used on [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") / [(Dross)](/wiki/Dross "Dross") [Dross](/wiki/Dross "Dross") II after collecting [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_1.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") [Knife Piece 1](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1"), a second [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_1.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") [Knife Piece 1](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") will spawn in the mirrored world's (Treasure Room) [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room"), which can be rerolled into a random item from the [Treasure Room (Item Pool)](/wiki/Treasure_Room_(Item_Pool) "Treasure Room (Item Pool)").
* If used on [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)") or [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") when the door to [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") has been opened, the golden key will not re-open the door and you will be unable to fight him.
* If used on an XL floor, the merged chapter can be re-generated as two separate floors instead.
* (Challenge Room) [Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room") and (Boss Challenge Room) [Boss Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Boss_Challenge_Room "Boss Challenge Room") will have the same rewards and enemy waves as the Challenge Room in the previous iteration of the floor.
* (Added in Repentance) If left in a Treasure or Boss Room and then returned to during the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent"), the Forget Me Now item will return to the room it was left each time it is used, allowing the floor to be repeated indefinitely.
	+ This can be useful in conjunction with (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/The_Stairway.png)](/wiki/The_Stairway "The Stairway") [The Stairway](/wiki/The_Stairway "The Stairway"), as it allows for unlimited Angel Shops to be visited.
	+ Upon reentry, items, pickups, and trinkets left in treasure and boss room after using Forget Me Now will be removed and not converted into cracked keys.
* If used in Floor 1, the chance of Devil/Angel room is still 0%.
