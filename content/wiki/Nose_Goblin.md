 # Nose Goblin ![image](/image/Nose_Goblin.png) 

Effects
---------


* Adds a chance to fire a homing booger tear that sticks to an enemy and deals damage over time.
	+ Multiple boogers can stick to one enemy to deal extra damage.
	+ Each booger deals damage equal to Isaac's tear damage every second.
	+ The booger lasts for 60 seconds or until the enemy dies.
		- (Added in Repentance) The booger lasts 10 seconds.
	+ Boogers cannot pierce and stick to the first enemy that they come in contact with.


Notes
-------


* Nose Goblin's effect is almost identical to [(Sinus Infection)](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") [Sinus Infection](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") beyond the added homing effect. Consequently, all its synergies apply to Nose Goblin.
	+ The effects have independent chances to trigger. If Isaac has both, there is a chance to fire either homing or non-homing boogers.
* Not affected by [Luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").


Synergies
-----------


* [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Bombs shot out can randomly become homing.
* [(Godhead)](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead") [Godhead](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead"): Shots retain their aura while stuck to an enemy, but the aura can only damage enemies other than the booger victim. If the enemy dies while duration remains, it will resume homing and will often stick to a second enemy.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): When dealing damage, there is a chance for a booger tear to attach to the affected enemy. Sometimes the brim will snap because of its homing effect.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): The tear has a random chance to turn green and disappear. This doesn't make the tear stick to enemies or grant any additional damage. The tear is respawned at Isaac's location.
	+ (Added in Repentance) When dealing damage, there is a chance for a booger tear to attach to the affected enemy.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Spirit Sword)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") When dealing damage, there is a chance for a booger tear to attach to the affected enemy. Applies to both swings and projectile swords.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology") / [(Tech X)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): No effect.

	+ (Added in Repentance) The laser can apply boogers, and has a pretty high chance in doing so.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Trisagion)](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion") [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion"): Overrides Nose Goblin.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Each tick of damage has a chance to attach a booger tear to the affected enemy.
