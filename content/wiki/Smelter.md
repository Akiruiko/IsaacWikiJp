* Trinkets whose effects only activate once, such as [(Store Credit)](/wiki/Store_Credit "Store Credit") [Store Credit](/wiki/Store_Credit "Store Credit"), [(Missing Poster)](/wiki/Missing_Poster "Missing Poster") [Missing Poster](/wiki/Missing_Poster "Missing Poster"), and [(Walnut)](/wiki/Walnut "Walnut") [Walnut](/wiki/Walnut "Walnut"), will still only activate once after being absorbed.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Perfection)](/wiki/Perfection "Perfection") [Perfection](/wiki/Perfection "Perfection") is still removed if Isaac takes damage from regular sources.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Faded Polaroid)](/wiki/Faded_Polaroid "Faded Polaroid") [Faded Polaroid](/wiki/Faded_Polaroid "Faded Polaroid") cannot be used to open the [Strange Door](/wiki/A_Strange_Door "A Strange Door") while smelted.
* It is possible to find previously smelted trinkets during a [victory lap](/wiki/Victory_Lap "Victory Lap"), or if the trinket Item Pool is exhausted.
* (Removed in Repentance) Picking up a copy of a trinket which was already absorbed will not duplicate that trinket's effect.
