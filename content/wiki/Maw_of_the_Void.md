(Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance)
* When the familiar is generated, Isaac will gain the familiar permanently as a passive item. This allows Isaac to drop the trinket while keeping the familiar.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The passive Tonsil item does not exist in any item pool; thus, this is the only way to find it and make it appear in the [Collection Page](/wiki/Collection_Page_(Afterbirth_%E2%80%A0)#Page_4 "Collection Page (Afterbirth †)") aside from starting with it as  [(Eden)](/wiki/Eden "Eden") [Eden](/wiki/Eden "Eden").
* (Removed in Repentance) If Eden starts with the passive tonsil item and picks up the trinket, the trinket will spawn only one familiar before being consumed.
* Sources of self-inflicted damage, like [(IV Bag)](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") [IV Bag](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") or [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine"), can spawn a familiar.
* Damage that is blocked by [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") or the (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Holy Card)](/wiki/Holy_Card "Holy Card") [Holy Card](/wiki/Holy_Card "Holy Card") does not count to the number of hits that are needed for the tonsil familiar to spawn.
