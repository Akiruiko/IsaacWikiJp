 # Rubber Cement ![image](/image/Rubber_Cement.png) 


Effects
---------


* Gives one [(Black Heart)](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart") [Black Heart](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart").
* (Added in Repentance) Once used, the (Boss Room) [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_Room "Boss Room") item pedestal for that [floor](/wiki/Floor "Floor") will be replaced by a Deal with the Devil. These items must be paid for as a normal [Devil Deal](/wiki/Devil_Room#Deals_with_the_Devil "Devil Room") would. This *does* affect (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") / (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") chance, so if Isaac takes this item, no Angel Rooms will appear for the rest of the run unless he has [![image](/image/Act_of_Contrition.png)](/wiki/Act_of_Contrition "Act of Contrition") [Act of Contrition](/wiki/Act_of_Contrition "Act of Contrition"), [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"), [![image](/image/Duality.png)](/wiki/Duality "Duality") [Duality](/wiki/Duality "Duality") or [![image](/image/Eucharist.png)](/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist") [Eucharist](/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist"). Alternatively, playing (Sacrifice Room) [Sacrifice Rooms](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room") and [(Confessional.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/1/1d/Confessional.png/revision/latest?cb=20210824103001) [Confessionals](/wiki/Machines#Confessional "Machines") (usually) allows Angel Rooms to spawn on the current floor.
	+ This does not affect [![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid"), [![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative"), or [![image](/image/Dad%27s_Note.png)](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note") [Dad's Note](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note").
* (Added in Afterbirth â€ ) This item belongs to the [Bookworm](/wiki/Bookworm "Bookworm") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Bookworm.


Notes
-------


* (Added in Repentance) Bosses with set drops aside from [(Mom)](/wiki/Mom "Mom") [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom") will still drop their normal item, but at the cost of one [Heart Container](/wiki/Heart_Container "Heart Container").
* (Added in Repentance) On XL floors, both items will become Devil Deals, even if Satanic Bible was only used once.
* (Added in Repentance) During [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent"), any devil items that were not picked up may be purchased for 15 pennies.
* (Added in Repentance)  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"),  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost"), and  [(Tainted Jacob)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") [Tainted Jacob](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") in his ghost form can safely take any (Boss Room) [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_Room "Boss Room") item pedestals and it has no effect on subsequent devil deals.
	+ This does not apply to the Lost form granted by the white fire on [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") / [(Dross)](/wiki/Dross "Dross") [Dross](/wiki/Dross "Dross") II. Taking a deal in this form will still remove hearts.
* (Added in Repentance) This does not affect the items dropped on [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void").
* (Added in Repentance) Using the Satanic Bible changes the Boss Room's item pool to the [Devil Room item pool](/wiki/Devil_Room_(Item_Pool) "Devil Room (Item Pool)") for purposes other than direct boss rewards as well. This works even if the boss does not normally drop items, such as [(Mom)](/wiki/Mom "Mom") [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom"), [(Satan)](/wiki/Satan "Satan") [Satan](/wiki/Satan "Satan"), or [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Boss)#.3F.3F.3F "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Boss)#.3F.3F.3F "??? (Boss)").
	+ Rerolls such as [![image](/image/The_D6.png)](/wiki/The_D6 "The D6") [The D6](/wiki/The_D6 "The D6"), [(Rune of Perthro)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Perthro") [Rune of Perthro](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), or [(Soul of Isaac)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Soul of Isaac") [Soul of Isaac](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") will generate Devil Room items.
	+ Using Satanic Bible *after* the Boss Room item has spawned, followed by any reroll, causes the new item to be drawn from the Devil Room item pool, but it will have no heart cost.


Synergies
