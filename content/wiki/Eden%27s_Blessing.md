Notes[]
-------


* The effect still occurs whether the run was successful or not, even if the run was restarted.
* The effect does not work if Eden's Blessing was obtained on a [seeded](/wiki/Seed "Seed") run, during a [Victory Lap](/wiki/Victory_Lap "Victory Lap"), a [RERUN](/wiki/RERUN "RERUN"), or during a [challenge](/wiki/Challenge "Challenge").
	+ Likewise, Eden's Blessing will not grant a free item at the start of a challenge or RERUN, instead granting the free item on the next valid run started.
		- Interestingly, seeded runs will still gain the benefit of banked Eden's Blessings, without depleting them. This means that it is possible to play an infinite amount of seeded runs, and they all start with a free item until a normal run is started.
* Even if Eden's Blessing is re-rolled, such as with the [(D4)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4") or [(D100)](/wiki/D100 "D100") [D100](/wiki/D100 "D100"), a random item will still be granted at the start of the next run.
	+ If Eden's Blessing is then regained through [(Glowing Hour Glass)](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass") [Glowing Hour Glass](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass"), only one extra item will be given.
	+ Absorbing Eden's Blessing with (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Void)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void") will not grant an extra item in the next run.
* Eden's Blessing can choose itself as the free item you gain, allowing for another free item in your next run.
* If more than one Eden's Blessing is acquired in a single run, that quantity of random items will be granted at the start of the next run, although it's capped at ten items.
	+ It is possible to obtain multiple copies of an item at once this way.
* If Eden's Blessing effect is obtained through (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Metronome)](/wiki/Metronome "Metronome") [Metronome](/wiki/Metronome "Metronome"), no extra item will be given.
* If gained from (Added in Repentance)[(Lemegeton)](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") [Lemegeton](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton"), it will not grant an item next run.
* Taking Eden's Blessing and then starting a run as (Added in Repentance) [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") will only give item(s) to Jacob.
* (Added in Repentance) As  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus"), the item will be given to his alive form.
	+ If  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") somehow acquires the item before flipping for the first time of the run, Eden's Blessing will be consumed upon flip and a random item will be granted to  [(Dead Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus") [Dead Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus").
* Using (Added in Repentance)[(R Key)](/wiki/R_Key "R Key") [R Key](/wiki/R_Key "R Key") will not consume Eden's Blessing.
