 # Book of Shadows ![image](/image/Book_of_Shadows.png) 


Effects
---------


* Gives Isaac a fat bird familiar that sits on Isaac's head until he takes damage.
* Upon taking damage, it will jump off of Isaac's head and land on the nearest enemy, dealing damage and creating a rock line in a random direction. For the rest of the room, it acts like [![image](/image/Dead_Bird.png)](/wiki/Dead_Bird "Dead Bird") [Dead Bird](/wiki/Dead_Bird "Dead Bird"), flying around, albeit slower, and dealing contact damage to enemies.
	+ Bird Cage does 45 damage to enemies it lands on and 10 damage per rock wave that hits enemies, then does 3 contact damage per tick while chasing enemies (9 damage per second). The rock waves can destroy obstacles.


Notes
-------


* If damage is taken in a room with no enemies, the familiar will directly go to the flying phase without performing the jump attack.
* Contact damage can be dealt to nearby enemies even when the familiar jumps off of Isaac's head.
* While the familiar is sitting on Isaac's head, it can be affected by certain character appearances. For example, it will appear fully black if obtained by  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Spawns 4 rock waves in an X pattern and doubles contact damage. Damage of the jump and the rock waves is unaffected.
* [![image](/image/Sacrificial_Altar.png)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar") [Sacrificial Altar](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar"): Can be used after the familiar has jumped.
* [![image](/image/Spin_to_Win.png)](/wiki/Spin_to_Win "Spin to Win") [Spin to Win](/wiki/Spin_to_Win "Spin to Win"): Boosts the familiar's damage while spinning, although has no effect on its speed.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Bird_Cage.png)](/wiki/Bird_Cage "Bird Cage") Bird Cage: Multiple copies of the item provide no benefit and won't make more than one familiar appear.
* [![image](/image/Box_of_Friends.png)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends"): Immediately makes the familiar jump, leaving a ghost copy on Isaac's head until he takes damage. This has no benefit to the damage dealt and will not spawn more than one familiar.
