Effect
--------


* Spawns a knife handle familiar that follows Isaac.
* Generates a room in [(Stage Mines icon.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/5/58/Stage_Mines_icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20210825172320) [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines") / [(Stage Ashpit icon.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/c/cf/Stage_Ashpit_icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20210825172340) [Ashpit](/wiki/Ashpit "Ashpit") II for [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") to spawn in.
* Combines with [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") to form a knife familiar that launches itself in the direction Isaac shoots, dealing 25 damage to and piercing enemies it hits.
* Launching it at the red door at the end of [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum")/[(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") II will open the door, destroying the knife in the process.


Notes
-------


* Isaac will remain as The Lost until after he has cleared a room of enemies; it does not matter whether this room is in the mirror world. His normal form will be restored upon entering any room outside the mirror world. This effect can extend to the next floor.
* If you don't have [![image](/image/Holy_Mantle.png)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") unlocked on  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"), you don't get Holy Mantle while in ghost form.
* The knife piece can be rerolled, in the event that [Mother](/wiki/Mother "Mother") is not the desired completion mark.
