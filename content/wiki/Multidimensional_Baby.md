Effects[]
---------


* Grants a permanent 50% chance to resurrect on [death](/wiki/Death "Death").
	+ Resurrection leaves Isaac at 1/2 of a [Red Heart](/wiki/Red_Heart "Red Heart"), or half a [Soul Heart](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") if he had no Red Heart Containers.
* This item belongs to the [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Guppy.


Notes[]
-------


* Resurrection items activate in a [set order](/wiki/Category:Revival_items "Category:Revival items"). Guppy's Collar is (Removed in Repentance) 4th / (Added in Repentance) 6th in this order after (Added in Repentance)[(Soul of Lazarus)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Soul of Lazarus") [Soul of Lazarus](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), [(1up!)](/wiki/1up! "1up!") [1up!](/wiki/1up! "1up!"),  [(Lazarus)](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus") [Lazarus](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus")' extra life, [(Dead Cat)](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") [Dead Cat](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat"), and (Added in Repentance)[(Inner Child)](/wiki/Inner_Child "Inner Child") [Inner Child](/wiki/Inner_Child "Inner Child").
* It is possible to obtain two collars by finding one in a [Red Chest](/wiki/Red_Chest "Red Chest"), without picking it up, and then finding another collar in a different Red Chest. (Removed in Repentance) However, this does not have any additional effects and does not count towards transforming into Guppy.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Obtaining multiple copies of Guppy's Collar now grants extra lives, depending on how many copies are obtained (obtaining a second collar displays the lives count as '2?', and so on). The chance for Guppy's Collar to activate is defined with separate rolls, but increases the odds for one of the collars to revive Isaac. Additional collars also count towards the Guppy transformation.
* Resurrecting in a (Curse Room) [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") may trap Isaac if he has no way of recovering health or exiting them without losing health.
* (Added in Afterbirth †) Resurrecting via Guppy's Collar during a [Daily Challenge](/wiki/Daily_Challenge "Daily Challenge") will count as a death, even if the run is eventually completed.


Bugs[]
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | (Removed in Afterbirth †) When the  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") is resurrected by Guppy's Collar, there is a chance he spawns with a Half Soul Heart instead of Coin Hearts. When an HP up is obtained, Keeper will have 1 Coin Heart, as well as the Half Soul Heart he had previously. When a second HP up is obtained, Keeper will lose the Half Soul Heart and have 2 Coin Hearts, like normal. |




| (Bug) Bug!
 | (Removed in Afterbirth †) Guppy's Collar can be exploited to gain infinite lives. When Isaac's last will is on the screen, close the game, re-open it, and continue the run. Isaac will appear to die again, and will also have a separate chance to be resurrected. |
