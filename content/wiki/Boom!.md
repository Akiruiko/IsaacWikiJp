 # Boom! ![image](/image/Boom!.png) 


Effects
---------


* 2x [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") multiplier.
* -0.5 [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed").
* (Removed in Repentance) 0.5x tears / 2x [tear delay](/wiki/Tear_delay "Tear delay") multiplier. (The player's tear value will always be halved.)
* (Added in Repentance) 0.66x tears / 1.5x tear delay multiplier.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Eve's Mascara is DPS neutral, though often the reduction of shot speed is a downgrade.
* Combos very well with any item that scales with damage but not with fire rate, such as [![image](/image/Rotten_Baby.png)](/wiki/Rotten_Baby "Rotten Baby") [Rotten Baby](/wiki/Rotten_Baby "Rotten Baby") or (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Fate%27s_Reward.png)](/wiki/Fate%27s_Reward "Fate's Reward") [Fate's Reward](/wiki/Fate%27s_Reward "Fate's Reward").
* (Added in Repentance) Eve's Mascara is effectively a 33% increase in DPS, and the shot speed down is no longer as detrimental due to changes in how range works.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Missiles are not affected by low shot speed and the fire rate difference is negligible, granting double damage with nearly no downside.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): The Knife is not affected by shot speed. Tears down and 2x damage multiplier still apply.
* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[![image](/image/Trisagion.png)](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion") [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion"): Beams turn black and do double damage. The low shot speed makes beams damage enemies more frequently.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Tech_X.png)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): Tech X actually benefits from low shot speed due to it staying on enemies longer, and is also not effected by range giving pretty much no downside.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Diplopia.png)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia"): The damage and tear multipliers do not stack. The shot speed decrease does stack.
* [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") / [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Shots travel a very short distance, so having (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Host_Hat.png)](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") [Host Hat](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") or [![image](/image/Pyromaniac.png)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") is strongly recommended.
* [![image](/image/Eve%27s_Mascara.png)](/wiki/Eve%27s_Mascara "Eve's Mascara") Eve's Mascara: No further effect when stacked.
* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): **Not recommended.** Tear travels very slowly, making it hard to kill mobile enemies.
