 # Blue Key ![image](/image/Blue_Key.png) 

Effects
---------


* Entering a room that requires a [key](/wiki/Key "Key") does not consume a key, but brings Isaac to a room resembling [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)"), which acts as an in-between of the two rooms.
	+ These rooms contain assortments of [Blue Gapers](/wiki/Gaper#Blue_Gaper "Gaper"), [Blue Boils](/wiki/Boil#Blue_Boil "Boil"), and/or [Blue Conjoined Fatties](/wiki/Fatty#Blue_Conjoined_Fatty "Fatty"), and are always long rooms (either normal or slim). They have a chance to give a reward when cleared, like normal rooms.
	+ Once exited, the room cannot be re-entered.


Notes
-------


* Doors that were unlocked with the trinket have a blue hue emitting from them instead of the normal floor-dependent hue.
* The doors leading to the entrance of [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") or [(Dross)](/wiki/Dross "Dross") [Dross](/wiki/Dross "Dross") can be unlocked for free by Blue Key, though the blue room generated will be a dead end. Leaving the way Isaac came in will leave the door unlocked, allowing the player to continue normally.
* Rooms that require money to enter ((Arcade) [Arcades](/wiki/Arcade "Arcade") or rooms affected by [(Pay to Play)](/wiki/Pay_to_Play "Pay to Play") [Pay to Play](/wiki/Pay_to_Play "Pay to Play")) can also be opened for free.
* Doors that require two keys to open, such as (Vault) [Vaults](/wiki/Vault "Vault") or (Dice Room) [Dice Rooms](/wiki/Dice_Room "Dice Room"), will be opened instantly instead of waiting for the animation of both keys to be used.
* The door leading to [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush") will also produce a blue room, despite not requiring a key.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Door_Stop.png)](/wiki/Door_Stop "Door Stop") [Door Stop](/wiki/Door_Stop "Door Stop") / [(Mercurius)](/wiki/Mercurius "Mercurius") [Mercurius](/wiki/Mercurius "Mercurius"): The blue room can be exited without fighting the enemies, and the door will remain unlocked.
