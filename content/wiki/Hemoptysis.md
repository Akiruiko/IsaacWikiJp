Effects[]
---------


* Spawns a demonic familiar that copies Isaac's tears.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Incubus' tears ignores Isaac's range and shot speed.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Incubus' damage is reduced by 25% when playing as characters other than  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith").


Notes[]
-------


* Lilith's starting Incubus is technically not a collected item but an intrinsic part of the character, and is removed if an item such as [(Ankh)](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") [Ankh](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") or (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Clicker)](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker") [Clicker](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker") are used to become a different character. As such, playing as Lilith will not add Incubus to the [collection page](/wiki/Collection_page "Collection page").
* Incubus is one of the familiars that can be spawned by [(Cambion Conception)](/wiki/Cambion_Conception "Cambion Conception") [Cambion Conception](/wiki/Cambion_Conception "Cambion Conception").
* (Added in Repentance) Incubus has the second highest priority of following familiars, below [(King Baby)](/wiki/King_Baby "King Baby") [King Baby](/wiki/King_Baby "King Baby").
* (Added in Repentance) This item belongs to the [Conjoined](/wiki/Conjoined "Conjoined") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a three-faced version of himself. Lilith's Incubus, however, does not count towards the transformation.

	+ The laser fired by Incubus has the same width as [(Lil Brimstone)](/wiki/Lil_Brimstone "Lil Brimstone") [Lil Brimstone](/wiki/Lil_Brimstone "Lil Brimstone")'s.
	+ (Added in Repentance) When playing as  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel"), Incubus' Brimstone laser has the same range as him.
