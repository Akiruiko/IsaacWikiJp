* Has no effect on certain items that are required to progress through the game, such as [(The Polaroid)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid"), [(Knife Piece 1)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") [Knife Piece 1](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1"), or [(Dad's Note)](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note") [Dad's Note](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note").
* No bonuses are granted from other items alluded to be edible, such as [(MEAT!)](/wiki/MEAT! "MEAT!") [MEAT!](/wiki/MEAT! "MEAT!").
* Removing collected food items or Binge Eater itself will also remove associated stat bonuses.
* Because this affects items in (Devil Room) [Devil Rooms](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") and all of them cost 1 Red Heart Container, Devil Deals can be used as free stat upgrades.
