 # Dr. Fetus ![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png) 

Effects
---------


* Tears are replaced with [bombs](/wiki/Bombs "Bombs") that explode approximately one second after being fired.
	+ (Removed in Afterbirth) Each bomb deals 3 times the character's normal [tear damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
	+ (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) Each bomb deals 5 times the character's normal tear damage plus a flat 30 damage. The flat 30 is not affected by damage multipliers.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Dr. Fetus has two formulas for calculating the damage it does. At first, each bomb deals 10 times the character's normal tear damage. If the previous formula would lead to the bombs doing more than 60 damage, the bombs instead deal 5 times the character's normal tear damage plus a 30 flat damage. The flat 30 is not affected by damage multipliers.
	+ [Tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears") down: Delay * 2.5.
	+ The [range](/wiki/Range "Range") and [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed") stats both affect the velocity at which the bombs are fired out. Delay before the explosion is not affected by either.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Bombs grow larger or smaller with tear size modifiers and deal no knockback to each other.
		- (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Angelic_Prism.png)](/wiki/Angelic_Prism "Angelic Prism") [Angelic Prism](/wiki/Angelic_Prism "Angelic Prism") Split bombs still deal knockback to eachother.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Dr. Fetus is a [special item](/wiki/Special_item "Special item").
* R U A Wizard? Does not affect Dr. Fetus.
* Dr. Fetus overrides multiple [tear effect](/wiki/Tear_effect "Tear effect") items, but benefit from some (but not all) bomb-enhancing effects like [![image](/image/Mr._Mega.png)](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") [Mr. Mega](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega").
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Many more synergies have been added, and all passive bomb modifiers affect Dr. Fetus.
* Dr. Fetus bombs deal half a heart of damage to Isaac. Other explosion damage is not affected.
	+ Self-damage is increased to a full heart if the bomb would deal 85 damage or more. This includes effects from bomb modifiers, not just raw base damage.

* [![image](/image/Kidney_Stone.png)](/wiki/Kidney_Stone "Kidney Stone") [Kidney Stone](/wiki/Kidney_Stone "Kidney Stone"): **Not recommended.** The range decrease applies, but since the tear height stat doesn't affect Dr. Fetus' bombs, they spawn directly in front of Isaac, making self-damage very likely.
