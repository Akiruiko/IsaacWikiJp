Effects[]
---------


* Gives Isaac [flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight") and two [soul hearts](/wiki/Health#Soul_Hearts "Health").
* Continuously firing for 2.35 seconds allows Isaac to fire a powerful holy laser when the fire buttons are released, similar to the attacks used by the [Angel](/wiki/Angel "Angel") bosses.
	+ The laser deals Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") per tick (up to a maximum of 15 times) and can be aimed diagonally. It lasts for ~1.28 seconds (77 frames).
		- With the `EnableMouseControl` enabled or an analog controller, the laser can be aimed in any direction, similar to [(Analog Stick)](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick") [Analog Stick](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick").
	+ Tear delay has no effect on the charge time of the laser — it is fixed at 2.35 seconds.
* This item belongs to the [Seraphim](/wiki/Seraphim_(Transformation) "Seraphim (Transformation)") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into an angel.


Notes[]
-------


* This item's effects will still work while [Blindfolded](/wiki/Blindfolded "Blindfolded"), which makes it extremely valuable for  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") and in [challenges](/wiki/Challenges "Challenges") such as [BRAINS!](/wiki/BRAINS! "BRAINS!").
* Having any charged tear effects like [(Monstro's Lung)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") or [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") will lower their DPS if their charge time is under 2.35 seconds, in order to use Revelation's laser.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Angelic Prism)](/wiki/Angelic_Prism "Angelic Prism") [Angelic Prism](/wiki/Angelic_Prism "Angelic Prism"): When the laser hits the prism, it will split in four.
* [(Anti-Gravity)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): The laser fires in place, not following Isaac.
* [(Brain Worm)](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm") [Brain Worm](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm"): The laser will bend completely to hit an enemy, effectively acting as a better form of homing on single enemies and bosses.
* [(Continuum)](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum") [Continuum](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum") The laser loops around, potentially hitting enemies twice.
* [(Eve's Mascara)](/wiki/Eve%27s_Mascara "Eve's Mascara") [Eve's Mascara](/wiki/Eve%27s_Mascara "Eve's Mascara")/[(Polyphemus)](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") [Polyphemus](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus"): As the laser deals Isaac’s damage, but is not affected by tear delay, the DPS of the laser is greatly increased.
* [(Lachryphagy)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): The laser will have reduced range, but will spawn a stream of red Lachryphagy tears.
* [(Multidimensional Baby)](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby"): If a Revelation laser is shot through the baby, it will double the laser.
* [(The Parasite)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): The laser will split both ways at 90 degree angles on contact with an enemy.
* [(Pop!)](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") [Pop!](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!"): The laser will have reduced range, but will shoot out eyeballs rapidly at its end.
	+ [(Pop!)](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") [Pop!](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") + [(Multidimensional Baby)](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby"): Lasers modified by Multidimensional Baby are no longer affected by Pop!, being normal length and not firing additional eyes out the end.
* [(Rubber Cement)](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement") [Rubber Cement](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement"): The laser will bounce off the walls for a short distance.
* [(Spoon Bender)](/wiki/Spoon_Bender "Spoon Bender") [Spoon Bender](/wiki/Spoon_Bender "Spoon Bender"): The laser will home in on enemies in a very effective way.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Almond Milk)](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk") [Almond Milk](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk")/[(Soy Milk)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): As the laser deals Isaac’s damage, but is not affected by tear delay, the DPS of the laser is greatly decreased.
* [(Diplopia)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia"): Multiple copies of Revelation have no extra effect.


* [(Ipecac)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): The laser will poison enemies and repeatedly explode on contact with an enemy or obstacle. Despite its high damage increase, Ipecac only adds +2 damage to the beam, similarly to [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone").
* [(Jacob's Ladder)](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder") [Jacob's Ladder](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder"): At any point the laser makes contact with an enemy or obstacle, lightning will jump from it.
* [(My Reflection)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection"): The laser makes a thin loop in front of Isaac, and fires the normal laser backwards.
* [(Mysterious Liquid)](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid") [Mysterious Liquid](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid"): The laser creates a pool of creep on contact with an enemy or obstacle.
* [(Playdough Cookie)](/wiki/Playdough_Cookie "Playdough Cookie") [Playdough Cookie](/wiki/Playdough_Cookie "Playdough Cookie"): The laser rapidly flashes between different colors while firing, with a chance to inflict status effects.
* [(Sulfuric Acid)](/wiki/Sulfuric_Acid "Sulfuric Acid") [Sulfuric Acid](/wiki/Sulfuric_Acid "Sulfuric Acid")/[(Terra)](/wiki/Terra "Terra") [Terra](/wiki/Terra "Terra"): The laser will occasionally break obstacles.
* [(Tech X)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): If the Revelation beam and the Tech X are both charged, it will sometimes fire the Revelation beam first and the Tech X ring at the end of it.


Bugs[]
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | When combined with [(Chocolate Milk)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"), [(Cursed Eye)](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") [Cursed Eye](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye"), [(Monstro's Lung)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") or [(Tech X)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"), releasing a Revelation attack may prevent a charged shot from firing at the same time as expected. The charged shot is delayed by about ~0.5 seconds. Holding a full charge for a longer time makes the delay more likely to happen.
