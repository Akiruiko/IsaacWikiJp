Effect[]
--------


* Spawns a crawling Leech [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that follows Isaac. If an enemy comes near, the Leech will attack and chase it, doing 1.5 damage per tick or about 3.2 damage per second. If an enemy is killed by the Leech, Isaac will be healed by a Half Red Heart.


Notes[]
-------


* The Leech's healing effect does not affect [characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") that do not have [Heart containers](/wiki/Health "Health").
	+ (Added in Afterbirth)  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper")/(Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") will be healed by The Leech.
* Enemies that turn into flesh piles and regenerate when killed such as [Globins](/wiki/Globin "Globin") and some [dark red champions](/wiki/Champion "Champion") regenerate quicker than the Leech can kill them. Isaac will gain half a heart each time the enemies collapse, granting an easy way to regenerate all Red Hearts. This can also open up many powerful synergies with any item that provides a benefit or resource when Isaac takes damage.
* Like [(Ghost Baby)](/wiki/Ghost_Baby "Ghost Baby") [Ghost Baby](/wiki/Ghost_Baby "Ghost Baby") can drop from [skulls](/wiki/Rocks#Skulls "Rocks"), Leech can rarely drop from the [buckets](/wiki/Rocks#Buckets "Rocks") in [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour").


Synergies[]
-----------


* [Arcade rooms](/wiki/Arcade_room "Arcade room"): The player can let the Leech eat [Flies](/wiki/Fly "Fly") from the [Shell Game](/wiki/Beggar "Beggar") and use the resulting health to gamble on the Blood Bank.
* [(BFFS!)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Leech grows bigger and does double damage. Still only heals for a Half Red Heart.
* [(E. Coli)](/wiki/E._Coli "E. Coli") [E. Coli](/wiki/E._Coli "E. Coli"): Enemies can be turned into [poop](/wiki/Poop_(disambiguation) "Poop (disambiguation)") at the cost of a Half Red Heart, then consumed by the leech to regain health. Utilization of temporary immunity when hit can allow multiple [enemies](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") to be turned into poop, resulting in a net gain of health.
* [(Flush!)](/wiki/Flush! "Flush!") [Flush!](/wiki/Flush! "Flush!"): The leech still can attack the enemies turned into poop and gain health.
* [(Gnawed Leaf)](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf") [Gnawed Leaf](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf"): The player can stand still and allow the Leech to clear a [room](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms"), granting simple clears and easy health.


* [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany"): Due to the fact that Tainted Bethanyâ€™s (Added in Repentance)[(Lemegeton)](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") [Lemegeton](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") gains charges with red hearts, leech can charge it up by killing enemies.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Maggy's Bow)](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Bow "Maggy's Bow") [Maggy's Bow](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Bow "Maggy's Bow"): No effect on healing.

| (Bug) Bug!
 | The Leech will continuously heal the player while it's attacking [Mama Gurdy](/wiki/Mama_Gurdy "Mama Gurdy").
