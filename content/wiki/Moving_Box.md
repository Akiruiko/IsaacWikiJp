 # Moving Box ![image](/image/Moving_Box.png) 

Effects
---------


* If the box is empty, it picks up items and pickups in a room and stores them.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Moving Box can carry up to 10 items or pickups at once, randomly picked (i.e. items are not prioritized).
* If the box is not empty, places all stored items and pickups in the current room.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) There is no limit to the number of items and pickups that can be held in the box.
* Any stored items and pickups unpacked from Moving Box will remain identical to what was originally packed; [pills](/wiki/Pills "Pills"), [cards, and runes](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") will stay the same, [(Sticky Nickel)](/wiki/Sticky_Nickel "Sticky Nickel") [Sticky Nickels](/wiki/Sticky_Nickel "Sticky Nickel") will remain stuck to the floor, and [chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests") will have the same contents as they would if they had been opened immediately.
* Active items keep their charge in the box.
* Stealing from (Shop) [Shops](/wiki/Shop "Shop") and (Devil Room) [Devil Rooms](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") is not possible; only items on pedestals will be packed up.
* (Removed in Repentance) If used in a (Challenge Room) [Challenge Room](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room") or a (Boss Challenge Room) [Boss Challenge Room](/wiki/Boss_Challenge_Room "Boss Challenge Room"), the objects within can be packed up without starting the challenge.
* If used in a room with a choice of multiple item pedestals, only one of the choice objects will be packed up and the rest behave normally.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Both items presented by [![image](/image/There%27s_Options.png)](/wiki/There%27s_Options "There's Options") [There's Options](/wiki/There%27s_Options "There's Options") and [![image](/image/More_Options.png)](/wiki/More_Options "More Options") [More Options](/wiki/More_Options "More Options") can be taken.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Both [![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") and [![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") can be taken.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) If used in the (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush"), one of the objects is packed up but the rush is not started. The remaining item choices start the rush as normal.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Using Moving Box in a (Challenge Room) [Challenge Room](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room") or the (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") starts the challenge.
	+ (Added in Repentance) If used in a room with a choice of multiple items, Moving Box will take one item and the others will disappear.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Moving Box works normally in [![image](/image/Death_Certificate.png)](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate") [Death Certificate](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate")'s area. Packing items in that special area won't activate the force-leaving mechanic.
* All existing Moving Boxes share their opened/closed state. Therefore, it is not possible to carry a Moving Box that is holding items within another Moving Box as the items must be unpacked first.
* (Added in Repentance) Disappearing pickups that are spawned by  [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") / [(Soul of Magdalene)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Soul of Magdalene") [Soul of Magdalene](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") or  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") can't be packed into Moving Box.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a box wisp on the middle ring. Moving Box must drop a pickup/item in order for it to spawn wisps. The wisps invoke the effect of [![image](/image/The_Book_of_Sin.png)](/wiki/The_Book_of_Sin "The Book of Sin") [The Book of Sin](/wiki/The_Book_of_Sin "The Book of Sin") when destroyed.
* [![image](/image/Glowing_Hour_Glass.png)](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass") [Glowing Hour Glass](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass"): If a charged Glowing Hour Glass is stored in the Moving Box, it can be unpacked and used, refunding charges to both items while rewinding time and essentially allowing unlimited use.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Activation swaps the contents of the box with the contents of the room.
* [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): This item's effect cannot be absorbed by Void. It will be treated as a passive item by the Void.
