 # Hairpin ![image](/image/Hairpin.png) 

Effects
---------


* Fully recharges Isaac's active item upon entering a boss fight.
	+ This effect only occurs the first time a Boss Room is entered; leaving and re-entering the Boss Room will not result in more recharges.


Notes
-------


* The trinket's effect will trigger once for each and every Boss Room. Even if there are multiple Boss rooms on the same floor for whatever reason ([(Curse of the Labyrinth.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/7/77/Curse_of_the_Labyrinth.png/revision/latest?cb=20211023085047) [Curse of the Labyrinth](/wiki/Curses "Curses"), [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void"))
* In [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode"), grants a full charge only for the two boss fights on the final level.
* The effect is identical to picking up a [battery](/wiki/Battery "Battery"), with caveats listed in interactions.
* (Added in Repentance) Recharges twice on [(Corpse)](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse") [Corpse](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse") II: 1st time happens when entering the boss room, 2nd time happens when entering the [(Mother)](/wiki/Mother "Mother") [Mother](/wiki/Mother "Mother") fight.
* (Added in Repentance) Does not fully recharge between [(Dogma)](/wiki/Dogma "Dogma") [Dogma](/wiki/Dogma "Dogma") and [(The Beast)](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast").


Interactions
--------------
