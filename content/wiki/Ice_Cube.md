 # Ice Cube ![image](/image/Ice_Cube.png) 

Effects
---------


* Upon entering a room, there is a chance that enemies will be [petrified](/wiki/Status_Effects "Status Effects"). Enemies that have been petrified by Ice Cube are also [frozen](/wiki/Status_Effects#Frozen "Status Effects") when killed, including those killed up to 2 seconds after the petrification effect ends.
	+ Petrification lasts for 4 seconds after entering the room.
	+ The chance for enemies to be petrified increases with [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck"). This also affects the number of enemies that are going to be frozen.
	+ Enemies spawned during [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode") waves will not be petrified.


Notes
-------


* The freezing effect is the same granted by [(Uranus)](/wiki/Uranus "Uranus") [Uranus](/wiki/Uranus "Uranus") tears.
* Bosses can be petrified although they cannot get frozen, even if killed while petrified.
* Every room has a predetermined set of enemies that are going to be petrified. Re-entering the room will not change this, similarly to [Champion](/wiki/Champion "Champion") enemies.
