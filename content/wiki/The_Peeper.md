Effects[]
---------


* Spawns a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that slowly floats diagonally around the room and bounces off walls. The eye blocks enemy shots and deals 8 damage per tick or about 17.1 damage per second to enemies it passes through.
* Gives tears shot from Isaacâ€™s left eye a red appearance. (Added in Repentance) All tears shot from the left eye will deal 34% more damage.


Notes[]
-------


* The empty eye leaves behind a small blood trail. This doesn't affect anything and is a purely cosmetic effect.
* The Peeper is distinguishable from the eyes emitted from [Peep](/wiki/Peep "Peep") by the size of the pupil, it being noticeably bigger on The Peeper.
* A slightly better Peeper familiar can be spawned by (Added in Repentance)[(The Scooper)](/wiki/The_Scooper "The Scooper") [The Scooper](/wiki/The_Scooper "The Scooper").
