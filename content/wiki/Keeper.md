概要

ノート
-------

* (Removed in Repentance) Keeper cannot have more than 2 [Coin Hearts](/wiki/Coin_Heart "Coin Heart").
* (Added in Repentance) Keeper cannot have more than 3 [Coin Hearts](/wiki/Coin_Heart "Coin Heart"). This cap applies even before Hush is defeated.
	+ The only three exceptions to this are (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Greed%27s_Gullet.png)](/wiki/Greed%27s_Gullet "Greed's Gullet") [Greed's Gullet](/wiki/Greed%27s_Gullet "Greed's Gullet"), which allows him to have up to 6 Coin Hearts, and (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") and (Added in Repentance)[(Mother's Kiss)](/wiki/Mother%27s_Kiss "Mother's Kiss") [Mother's Kiss](/wiki/Mother%27s_Kiss "Mother's Kiss"), which allow him to have a 4th Coin Heart.
		- (Added in Repentance) Greed's Gullet in combination with [![image](/image/Deep_Pockets.png)](/wiki/Deep_Pockets "Deep Pockets") [Deep Pockets](/wiki/Deep_Pockets "Deep Pockets") can allow Keeper to reach 12 coin hearts at 600 coins.
			* It is possible to reach 15 coin hearts at 900 coins. Any coin heart container past the max of 12 will appear as an additional row beneath the standard two rows of coin hearts, similar to  [(Magdalene)](/wiki/Magdalene "Magdalene") [Magdalene](/wiki/Magdalene "Magdalene")'s (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright").
	+ Theoretically, Keeper could gain limitless coin hearts by generating and smelting Mother's Kiss, as each copy would grant a heart container, eventually bypassing the 12 heart container cap.
	+ If the effect of (Added in Repentance)[(Mother's Kiss)](/wiki/Mother%27s_Kiss "Mother's Kiss") [Mother's Kiss](/wiki/Mother%27s_Kiss "Mother's Kiss") is doubled via [Mom's Box](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box") or a [Golden Trinket](/wiki/Golden_Trinket "Golden Trinket"), keeper will also receive an extra coin.
* Keeper always takes one full Coin Heart of damage, which means he generally cannot have half Coin Hearts.
	+ Because Keeper can usually not have less than one full heart, items such as [![image](/image/Whore_of_Babylon.png)](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") [Whore of Babylon](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") and [![image](/image/Empty_Vessel.png)](/wiki/Empty_Vessel "Empty Vessel") [Empty Vessel](/wiki/Empty_Vessel "Empty Vessel") cannot be activated.
	+ The effects of (Removed in Afterbirth †) [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Collar.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Collar "Guppy's Collar") [Guppy's Collar](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Collar "Guppy's Collar") and (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Clicker.png)](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker") [Clicker](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker") can allow Keeper to have half Coin Hearts.
		- (Added in Afterbirth †) [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Collar.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Collar "Guppy's Collar") [Guppy's Collar](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Collar "Guppy's Collar") now gives Keeper one full Coin Heart upon respawning.
* The amount of blue flies created from each heart depends on the type of heart.
	+ [Half Red Hearts](/wiki/Half_Red_Heart "Half Red Heart") are transformed into 1 blue fly.
	+ Full [Red Hearts](/wiki/Red_Heart "Red Heart"), (Added in Afterbirth †) [Blended Hearts](/wiki/Blended_Heart "Blended Heart"), (Added in Afterbirth †) [half Soul Hearts](/wiki/Half_Soul_Heart "Half Soul Heart"), and (Added in Repentance) [Rotten Hearts](/wiki/Rotten_Heart "Rotten Heart") are transformed into 2 blue flies.
	+ Full [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Soul_Hearts "Soul Hearts") are transformed into 3 blue flies.
	+ [Black Hearts](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart"), [Double Hearts](/wiki/Double_Heart "Double Heart"), and (Added in Afterbirth †) [Bone Hearts](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart") are transformed into 4 blue flies.
	+ [Eternal Hearts](/wiki/Eternal_Heart "Eternal Heart") are transformed into 5 blue flies.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) [Gold Hearts](/wiki/Gold_Heart "Gold Heart") are transformed into 6 blue flies.
* Every time Keeper uses a coin to heal himself, that coin is consumed and isn't added to his current coin amount.
	+ Double Pennies, Nickels, Dimes, and [![image](/image/A_Quarter.png)](/wiki/A_Quarter "A Quarter") [A Quarter](/wiki/A_Quarter "A Quarter") will give 1, 4, 9, and 24 coins respectively if used to heal.
	+ Using a Lucky Penny to refill health will not give a coin, but will still give +1 Luck.
	+ [(2 of Diamonds)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "2 of Diamonds") [2 of Diamonds](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") can refill Keeper's health at the cost of 1 coin.
	+ [(Counterfeit Penny)](/wiki/Counterfeit_Penny "Counterfeit Penny") [Counterfeit Penny](/wiki/Counterfeit_Penny "Counterfeit Penny") allows the chance for Keeper to gain the full value of a coin while healing.
* Coin Hearts are generally treated as Red Hearts, such as in (Removed in Repentance)[Devil](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room")/[Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") chance,(Removed in Repentance) [Devil deals](/wiki/Devil_deal "Devil deal"), [Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room"), [Boss Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Boss_Challenge_Room "Boss Challenge Room"), and items such as (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Dark_Prince%27s_Crown.png)](/wiki/Dark_Prince%27s_Crown "Dark Prince's Crown") [Dark Prince's Crown](/wiki/Dark_Prince%27s_Crown "Dark Prince's Crown").
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Taking a Devil deal costing 2 Red Hearts will kill Keeper.
* (Added in Repentance) Getting hit will not lower the chance for a Devil/Angel room to appear.
* (Removed in Repentance) If Keeper doesn't have maximum Coin Heart containers, using [(XI - Strength)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XI - Strength") [XI - Strength](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") will give Keeper an additional Coin Heart that does not disappear upon leaving the room.
* [![image](/image/IV_Bag.png)](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") [IV Bag](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") only gives Keeper 0-1 coins per use (instead of 1-3).
* (Added in Repentance) [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine") aren't guaranteed to pay Keeper out with a coin.
* [![image](/image/Piggy_Bank.png)](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank") [Piggy Bank](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank") only allows Keeper to drop 0-1 pennies when taking damage (instead of 1-2).
	+ (Added in Repentance)Having a partner in True Co-Op mode can get around this, as the Co-Op partner will drop pennies normally (as long as they are not Keeper themselves), giving Keeper a reliable source of health.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Swallowed Penny)](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny") [Swallowed Penny](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny") only allows Keeper to drop 0-1 pennies when taking damage (instead of 1).
* Despite having an innate triple shot, Keeper does not start with [![image](/image/The_Inner_Eye.png)](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") [The Inner Eye](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye"). Because of this, the item can still spawn.
	+ (Removed in Repentance)The Inner Eye grants six shots with a reduced fire rate.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The Inner Eye grants four shots with a reduced fire rate.
* (Added in Repentance) Health Down [pills](/wiki/Pill "Pill") cannot spawn while playing as Keeper.
* In Co-op mode, when Keeper dies, his ghost baby will maintain his innate triple shot.
* (Added in Repentance) In Co-op mode, Keeper will not convert hearts into flies unless he's granted them directly by an item.
* (Added in Repentance) In Co-op mode, Devil Deals will use coins for all players if Keeper is being played.

戦略
--------------

* Due to his (Removed in Repentance)2/(Added in Repentance)3 Coin Heart limit, Keeper can easily die due to fast shooting enemies, and (Removed in Repentance)Devil Deals costing 2 Red Hearts will kill him. As all hearts turn into flies, Soul/Black Hearts cannot be found to protect the Keeper's health.
* It is strongly recommended to defeat [Isaac](/wiki/Isaac_(Boss) "Isaac (Boss)") as soon as possible so that Keeper has the [![image](/image/Wooden_Nickel.png)](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel") [Wooden Nickel](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel"), which will vastly improve his survivability.
	+ (Removed in Afterbirth †) Keeper can take a 2 heart Devil Deal by spawning in a co-op baby, taking the devil deal, then quickly getting rid of the co-op baby, which will leave Keeper with one Coin Heart.
* Leaving a few coins on the ground when clearing a floor makes Keeper able to heal himself in the case where he would take a hit from an enemy.
* Try to bomb as many urns as possible during Chapter 1; [(Swallowed Penny)](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny") [Swallowed Penny](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny") can drop from urns, which is amazing as Keeper (see Good Items).
	+ Urns can also appear in [angel rooms](/wiki/Angel_room "Angel room"), [arcades](/wiki/Arcade "Arcade"), and the [(Cathedral)](/wiki/Cathedral "Cathedral") [Cathedral](/wiki/Cathedral "Cathedral").
* In [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode"), as coins spawn during waves, Keeper can easily heal himself during each wave by leaving some coins on the ground, even if this will decrease the amount of coins he will be able to collect and spend in the Shop. [Ultra Greed](/wiki/Ultra_Greed "Ultra Greed") attacks make the player lose coins when damaged, which means that Keeper can heal himself as long as he possesses coins.
* (Removed in Repentance) It is possible to take a 2 Red Heart Devil Deal by using [(Judas' Tongue)](/wiki/Judas%27_Tongue "Judas' Tongue") [Judas' Tongue](/wiki/Judas%27_Tongue "Judas' Tongue"), a [Health Up Pill](/wiki/Pill "Pill"), or [(XI - Strength)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XI - Strength") [XI - Strength](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") right after paying for the item. This would leave Keeper at 1 health coin (empty if it was recovered using the pill, but he will not be killed), which is quite risky as he would be one hit away from death. However, if the boss item is a normally-useless HP up ([![image](/image/Stem_Cells.png)](/wiki/Stem_Cells "Stem Cells") [Stem Cells](/wiki/Stem_Cells "Stem Cells"), [![image](/image/A_Snack.png)](/wiki/A_Snack "A Snack") [A Snack](/wiki/A_Snack "A Snack"), etc.), it can make even a 2-heart Devil Deal effectively free if you possess a Strength Card and take the boss item after leaving the Devil Room.
* As Keeper starts with triple shot, his tear rate is quite low, and this can be troublesome against fast enemies or large groups. Finding Tears Up items/Pills on the early floors will be useful to clear rooms. Items/trinkets increasing the tears' hitbox are also useful as enemies can be hit by two or three tears more easily.
* Curse Rooms are very risky to enter as Keeper. Entering it through the door will leave you at one Health, which means if you don't find any coins there, it will end your run. Even with the [![image](/image/Wooden_Nickel.png)](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel") [Wooden Nickel](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel") unlocked, it's not guaranteed that you will leave the Curse Room alive.
* (Added in Repentance) After defeating Hush, entering a cursed room and leaving through the door will leave you at one Health, which means if you get hit by an enemy inside the room, it will end your run. The [![image](/image/Wooden_Nickel.png)](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel") [Wooden Nickel](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel") does make it somewhat less risky, however.
	+ Pills should be used outside of the Curse Room because using an "Addicted!" pill will kill you when you try to leave the room.
	+ However, it is possible to enter the Curse Room and remain at full health. This is achieved with a coin in the room right next to the Curse Room's door, most easily achieved with Wooden Nickel. The player can then walk into the Curse Room doorframe to take damage, quickly pick up the coin and heal, then walk through the door into the Curse Room while their invincibility frames is still active.
* Pills can be risky to use as the Keeper since many have adverse effects, with many of them able to quickly ruin a run should they happen. Picking up [![image](/image/PHD.png)](/wiki/PHD "PHD") [PHD](/wiki/PHD "PHD") is recommended before trying any pills.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The Hematemesis pill will reduce your health, but in exchange, spawn many flies.
		- (Added in Repentance) The Hematemesis pill will spawn many [coins](/wiki/Coin "Coin") on the floor, making it very useful for quick health regeneration.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Health Down pills are excluded from the pool while playing as Keeper.
* (Removed in Repentance)Hold onto any [(Joker)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Joker") [Joker](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") cards: you will probably be given an item that increases health at some point in your run; before taking it, use your Joker to see if any one-heart devil deals are available.
	+ (Removed in Repentance)Keeper's health coins count as Red Hearts for a devil/angel door appearing at all, making Joker Cards, [![image](/image/Goat_Head.png)](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head") [Goat Head](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head"), or (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Eucharist.png)](/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist") [Eucharist](/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist") invaluable in getting into devil/angel rooms.
* Co-op babies can be used to exploit [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Machines#Blood_Donation_Machine "Machines") and [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_beggar "Devil beggar") because babies still spawn with a whole heart while Keeper always has a full coin; thus, the baby's health can be replenished by spawning/respawning.
	+ Doesn't work in [Chapter 4](/wiki/Chapter_4 "Chapter 4") and beyond unless Keeper has [![image](/image/The_Wafer.png)](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer") [The Wafer](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer").
* In fights against [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush") and [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan"), bring [(X - Wheel of Fortune)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "X - Wheel of Fortune") [X - Wheel of Fortune](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): they will not attack you until you get closer to the center of the room, allowing you to spawn lots of coins from the [slot machine](/wiki/Slot_machine "Slot machine") for healing in the middle of battle.
* The Keeper can utilize [Sacrifice Rooms](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room") much more reliably and efficiently than other characters. To do this, instead of picking up extra dropped coins, leave them all on the floor. When you find a sacrifice room, you can repeatedly step on the spikes for a reward, then go pick up a penny left on the floor. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with your rewards. This process is easier in *Repentance*, as the player can start with 3 coin hearts rather then 2.
* Once unlocked, [(Rib of Greed)](/wiki/Rib_of_Greed "Rib of Greed") [Rib of Greed](/wiki/Rib_of_Greed "Rib of Greed") is particularly useful for Keeper, since it increases the chances of coins dropping after a room clear in place of hearts. This allows for more opportunities to heal.


### Wooden Nickel


After beating Cathedral with Keeper, he will start with [![image](/image/Wooden_Nickel.png)](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel") [Wooden Nickel](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel"), giving Keeper a source of potential free coin.



* It's usually a good idea to use the Wooden Nickel right after entering a room, so that the coin dropped will also work as emergency healing.
* [![image](/image/The_Battery.png)](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery") [The Battery](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery"), [![image](/image/9_Volt.png)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt"), [![image](/image/Charged_Baby.png)](/wiki/Charged_Baby "Charged Baby") [Charged Baby](/wiki/Charged_Baby "Charged Baby"), and [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") help to further increase the amount of coins produced. Having [![image](/image/Habit.png)](/wiki/Habit "Habit") [Habit](/wiki/Habit "Habit") will recharge the Wooden Nickel whenever Keeper is hit, allowing him to potentially sustain himself endlessly, as long as the Wooden Nickel pays out. Having [![image](/image/Habit.png)](/wiki/Habit "Habit") [Habit](/wiki/Habit "Habit") and [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") increases chances for infinite coins.
* Sacrifice rooms can be used much more with the Wooden Nickel, as the coins gained from it can be spent on them.


### Shops


After beating Sheol with Keeper, he will start with [(Store Key)](/wiki/Store_Key "Store Key") [Store Key](/wiki/Store_Key "Store Key"), giving Keeper free access to Shops. 


The following shop items are particularly useful for Keeper:



* [![image](/image/Hive_Mind.png)](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind") [Hive Mind](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind"): Enhances the many [blue flies](/wiki/Blue_fly "Blue fly") Keeper will naturally produce.
* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Any [orbital familiars](/wiki/Orbital_familiar "Orbital familiar") are important to protect the Keeper's low health, so increasing their size is always good.
* [![image](/image/Piggy_Bank.png)](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank") [Piggy Bank](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank"): Drops 0-1 coins with Keeper instead of 1-2, but still provides increased survivability.
	+ (Added in Repentance) In Co-Op, a player not using Keeper can take the Piggy Bank instead for its full benefit and thus supply Keeper with coins when necessary.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Box.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box") [Mom's Box](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box"): Can drop [(Swallowed Penny)](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny") [Swallowed Penny](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny"), and makes Swallowed Penny drop two coins instead of one, resulting in infinite money.
	+ (Added in Repentance) While this no longer results in infinite money, having a Swallowed Penny that's twice as effective will drastically increases survivability.
* Any Battery type items; *see [Keeper#Wooden Nickel](/wiki/Keeper#Wooden_Nickel "Keeper")*
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Sharp_Plug.png)](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug") [Sharp Plug](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug") takes only one HP on use.



アイテム効果
-------------------

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright"): Raises Keeper's HP cap by 1.


### Good Items


* Because of Keeper's slow rate of fire, any Tears Up items are a boon to him. His tears stat can be raised higher than the normal Inner Eye cap with enough Tears Up. This is because his low Tears stat is separate from his triple shot effect, allowing him to hit the standard Tears levels while having triple shots.
* Flight is useful in general, and it also lets Keeper enter Curse Rooms with less risk.
* Since every heart is changed into flies, items that give extra Heart drops like [![image](/image/Gimpy.png)](/wiki/Gimpy "Gimpy") [Gimpy](/wiki/Gimpy "Gimpy"), [![image](/image/The_Virus.png)](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus") [The Virus](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus"), [![image](/image/Old_Bandage.png)](/wiki/Old_Bandage "Old Bandage") [Old Bandage](/wiki/Old_Bandage "Old Bandage"), [![image](/image/Fanny_Pack.png)](/wiki/Fanny_Pack "Fanny Pack") [Fanny Pack](/wiki/Fanny_Pack "Fanny Pack"), [(Bloody Penny)](/wiki/Bloody_Penny "Bloody Penny") [Bloody Penny](/wiki/Bloody_Penny "Bloody Penny"), [![image](/image/Serpent%27s_Kiss.png)](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") [Serpent's Kiss](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss"), [![image](/image/Little_C.H.A.D..png)](/wiki/Little_C.H.A.D. "Little C.H.A.D.") [Little C.H.A.D.](/wiki/Little_C.H.A.D. "Little C.H.A.D."), or [![image](/image/The_Relic.png)](/wiki/The_Relic "The Relic") [The Relic](/wiki/The_Relic "The Relic") become great sources to generate flies. Having [![image](/image/Hive_Mind.png)](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind") [Hive Mind](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind") also helps Keeper deal extra damage to enemies.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/1up!.png)](/wiki/1up! "1up!") [1up!](/wiki/1up! "1up!")/[![image](/image/Dead_Cat.png)](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") [Dead Cat](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") will allow Keeper to trade all of his health coins in Devil deals, reviving him with 1 health coin for Dead Cat and 0 health coins and 1/2 soul heart for 1up. Keeper can later regain lost health coins with health up items.
* [![image](/image/20/20.png)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") causes Keeper to shoot 5 tears in an arc, without decreasing his fire rate.
	+ (Added in Repentance) [![image](/image/20/20.png)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") grants a similar effect to [![image](/image/Odd_Mushroom_(Thin).png)](/wiki/Odd_Mushroom_(Thin) "Odd Mushroom") [Odd Mushroom](/wiki/Odd_Mushroom_(Thin) "Odd Mushroom (Thin)"), giving Keeper a massive Tears Up in exchange for a Damage Down.
* [(Blind Rage)](/wiki/Blind_Rage "Blind Rage") [Blind Rage](/wiki/Blind_Rage "Blind Rage") has good synergy with money-dropping items. Since coins need to complete its animation before you can collect it, the extra invincibility frames give you a bigger window of opportunity to pick them up.
* [![image](/image/Cursed_Eye.png)](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") [Cursed Eye](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") allows him to fire 12 tears without an increase in tear delay.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Dim Bulb)](/wiki/Dim_Bulb "Dim Bulb") [Dim Bulb](/wiki/Dim_Bulb "Dim Bulb") is very useful if you keep the Wooden Nickel, as using it at the start of any room or beforehand will grant a hefty boost to most stats.
* [![image](/image/Diplopia.png)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia")/[(Credit Card)](/wiki/Credit_Card "Credit Card") [Credit Card](/wiki/Credit_Card "Credit Card") can be used to take Devil Deal items without spending any hearts/ (Added in Repentance)coins.
* [![image](/image/Glass_Cannon.png)](/wiki/Glass_Cannon "Glass Cannon") [Glass Cannon](/wiki/Glass_Cannon "Glass Cannon") works good in early game for killing bosses and large groups of fast enemies, especially when holding (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Dark_Prince%27s_Crown.png)](/wiki/Dark_Prince%27s_Crown "Dark Prince's Crown") [Dark Prince's Crown](/wiki/Dark_Prince%27s_Crown "Dark Prince's Crown") or [![image](/image/Dead_Cat.png)](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") [Dead Cat](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat"). It's also useful for speeding up the run when the player's goal is Boss Rush or Blue Womb.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Greed%27s_Gullet.png)](/wiki/Greed%27s_Gullet "Greed's Gullet") [Greed's Gullet](/wiki/Greed%27s_Gullet "Greed's Gullet") allows Keeper's health to extend past 2 coins, which is normally impossible. DO NOT pick up Dead Cat if you have all available health points using Greed's Gullet. This will instantly kill you, and when you are brought back by the Dead Cat, you will have only 1 hit point which you can no longer increase.
* [![image](/image/Head_of_the_Keeper.png)](/wiki/Head_of_the_Keeper "Head of the Keeper") [Head of the Keeper](/wiki/Head_of_the_Keeper "Head of the Keeper") is very useful since enemies will drop coins when hit, which will help Keeper stay alive.
	+ When combined with [![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"), it practically guarantees a steady stream of coin drops. This makes the Keeper effectively immortal as long as he keeps collecting those coins.
* [![image](/image/Holy_Mantle.png)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") allows Keeper to enter and leave Curse Rooms with less risk.
* [![image](/image/The_Inner_Eye.png)](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") [The Inner Eye](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye")/[![image](/image/Mutant_Spider.png)](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") [Mutant Spider](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") cause Keeper's fire rate to drop considerably, but he shoots 6/7 tears in an arc, allowing for greater damage output.
	+ (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Mutant_Spider.png)](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") [Mutant Spider](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") will shoot 5 tears with reduced fire rate.
	+ (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/The_Inner_Eye.png)](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") [The Inner Eye](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") now shoots 4 tears with a reduced fire rate.
* [(Lucky Rock)](/wiki/Lucky_Rock "Lucky Rock") [Lucky Rock](/wiki/Lucky_Rock "Lucky Rock") can allow Keeper to get coins from rocks as long as he has bombs.
* [![image](/image/Missing_Page_2.png)](/wiki/Missing_Page_2 "Missing Page 2") [Missing Page 2](/wiki/Missing_Page_2 "Missing Page 2") will activate every time Keeper takes damage, making it an effective replacement to [![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative")'s [![image](/image/The_Necronomicon.png)](/wiki/The_Necronomicon "The Necronomicon") [The Necronomicon](/wiki/The_Necronomicon "The Necronomicon") effect.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Moving_Box.png)](/wiki/Moving_Box "Moving Box") [Moving Box](/wiki/Moving_Box "Moving Box") can be used to drop multiple coins in a potentially harder room or boss fight.
* [![image](/image/Piggy_Bank.png)](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank") [Piggy Bank](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank") works differently with Keeper and doesn't drop coins every time he takes damage. Still, it allows him to sometimes recover from a hit for free. (Added in Repentance) The same is true for [(Swallowed Penny)](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny") [Swallowed Penny](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny").
* [![image](/image/Placenta.png)](/wiki/Placenta "Placenta") [Placenta](/wiki/Placenta "Placenta") regeneration effect affects the health coins just like regular red hearts and will allow the Keeper to regenerate 1 health coin every minute. As Keeper does not benefit from items that trigger at half a red heart, this item has no downsides.
* [![image](/image/Portable_Slot.png)](/wiki/Portable_Slot "Portable Slot") [Portable Slot](/wiki/Portable_Slot "Portable Slot") can be used to generate coins to heal Keeper during extended fights and in some cases might be better than [![image](/image/Wooden_Nickel.png)](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel") [Wooden Nickel](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel") when money is not a concern.
* [![image](/image/Pyromaniac.png)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") is great with Keeper too, because now you can also heal yourself with all explosions. Combine this with a good bomb item like [![image](/image/Kamikaze!.png)](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!") [Kamikaze!](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!"), [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"), [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"), [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") and you'll be almost immortal.
* Items that restore red hearts directly such as [![image](/image/Leech.png)](/wiki/Leech "Leech") [Leech](/wiki/Leech "Leech") and [![image](/image/Yum_Heart.png)](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart") [Yum Heart](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart") will heal Keeper.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Swallowed Penny)](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny") [Swallowed Penny](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny") is very powerful as Keeper will always be able to heal himself after taking a hit. This can also grant unlimited money since this will sometimes drop a nickel or a dime. However, invincibility after taking damage does not last long enough to pick up the money without risk of death.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) The coin dropped on hit can be picked up before Keeper's invincibility frames end, making Swallowed Penny even better for him.
	+ If Keeper takes damage from entering a [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room"), the coin will be dropped on the outside and can't be used to heal before leaving.
		- However, if one quickly enters, exits to collect the coin, and re-enters the room before the invulnerability period ends, the Swallowed Penny allows the Curse Room to be traversed with no net loss in life. Just be wary that there may be enemies in the curse room that would lock the door and prevent the player from leaving and collecting the coin outside the curse room.
	+ Obtaining Swallowed Penny means you can play Blood Donation Machines, Devil Beggars and [Sacrifice Rooms](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room") practically for free until they pay out since each time you donate a coin to them, you get a coin back.
	+ (Added in Repentance)You are no longer guaranteed to get a coin back.
* [![image](/image/Tech_X.png)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") synergizes well with Keeper's triple shot.
* [![image](/image/Tractor_Beam.png)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") will make all 3 of Keeper's tears travel along the beam, hitting a single target all at the same time and effectively increasing damage output.


### Bad Items


* Health Ups are useless when Keeper has maximum health (3 health coins). They still heal him if he has unfilled health coins.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Alabaster_Box.png)](/wiki/Alabaster_Box "Alabaster Box") [Alabaster Box](/wiki/Alabaster_Box "Alabaster Box") can only be charged with items that directly give Soul Hearts to the player, as Soul Hearts spawned on the ground will be converted into blue flies.
* (Removed in Repentance) Devil Deals requiring 2 Red Hearts cannot be taken unless Keeper has a resurrection item, (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Coupon.png)](/wiki/Coupon "Coupon") [Coupon](/wiki/Coupon "Coupon"), [(Credit Card)](/wiki/Credit_Card "Credit Card") [Credit Card](/wiki/Credit_Card "Credit Card"), [![image](/image/Diplopia.png)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia"), [Strength](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Tarot_Cards "Cards and Runes"), a [Health Up Pill](/wiki/Pill "Pill"), or [(Judas' Tongue)](/wiki/Judas%27_Tongue "Judas' Tongue") [Judas' Tongue](/wiki/Judas%27_Tongue "Judas' Tongue").
* (Added in Repentance)[(Judas' Tongue)](/wiki/Judas%27_Tongue "Judas' Tongue") [Judas' Tongue](/wiki/Judas%27_Tongue "Judas' Tongue") is completely useless with Keeper. It won't decrease 30 Cent devil deals to 15 Cents, and does not have any other effect.
* It is not recommended to take [![image](/image/Bum_Friend.png)](/wiki/Bum_Friend "Bum Friend") [Bum Friend](/wiki/Bum_Friend "Bum Friend") or [![image](/image/Bumbo.png)](/wiki/Bumbo "Bumbo") [Bumbo](/wiki/Bumbo "Bumbo"), as they will pick up coins off the ground that could have been used as health.
* (Removed in Repentance) Taking [![image](/image/Abaddon.png)](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") [Abaddon](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") will instantly kill Keeper, since it takes away all red health and Keeper cannot make use of the Black Hearts given. Amusingly, it will spawn a lot of flies in the process.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Taking [![image](/image/Abaddon.png)](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") [Abaddon](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") will not kill Keeper as in previous versions, but it will reduce his health to one Coin Heart.
* [![image](/image/Empty_Vessel.png)](/wiki/Empty_Vessel "Empty Vessel") [Empty Vessel](/wiki/Empty_Vessel "Empty Vessel") does not work with Keeper, as health coins count as red heart containers.
* [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Paw.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") [Guppy's Paw](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") will remove a health coin and spawn 9 blue flies. Removing all health coins with Guppy's Paw will not kill the Keeper immediately, but he will die upon picking up an item.
* [![image](/image/Maggy%27s_Bow.png)](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Bow "Maggy's Bow") [Maggy's Bow](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Bow "Maggy's Bow"), [![image](/image/The_Jar.png)](/wiki/The_Jar "The Jar") [The Jar](/wiki/The_Jar "The Jar"), [![image](/image/Dark_Bum.png)](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum") [Dark Bum](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum"), [![image](/image/Immaculate_Conception.png)](/wiki/Immaculate_Conception "Immaculate Conception") [Immaculate Conception](/wiki/Immaculate_Conception "Immaculate Conception") and will not provide Keeper any benefit, as all heart pickups turn into flies.
* [(Maggy's Faith)](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Faith "Maggy's Faith") [Maggy's Faith](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Faith "Maggy's Faith") does nothing for Keeper and will not grant 5 blue flies when traveling to the next floor, like it would if an Eternal Heart spawned.
* [![image](/image/Monstro%27s_Lung.png)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") will take a dangerously long time to charge, giving it terrible usability.
* [![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid"), [![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") ((Added in Repentance) though the damage up still applies), or [![image](/image/Whore_of_Babylon.png)](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") [Whore of Babylon](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") cannot be triggered by the Keeper since he can't have half a heart of health. (Removed in Repentance) An exception is after being revived by [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Collar.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Collar "Guppy's Collar") [Guppy's Collar](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Collar "Guppy's Collar"), which is presumably a bug.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Heartbreak.png)](/wiki/Heartbreak "Heartbreak") [Heartbreak](/wiki/Heartbreak "Heartbreak") will instantly kill Keeper by replacing all his coin hearts with broken hearts.
* (Added in Repentance)[(III - The Empress?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "III - The Empress?") [III - The Empress?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") will temporarily boost the Keeper's HP to 3 hearts, but then remove all hearts and bring him down to 1 Heart even if he grabs an HP up during its active time.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Apple of Sodom)](/wiki/Apple_of_Sodom "Apple of Sodom") [Apple of Sodom](/wiki/Apple_of_Sodom "Apple of Sodom"), (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Candy_Heart.png)](/wiki/Candy_Heart "Candy Heart") [Candy Heart](/wiki/Candy_Heart "Candy Heart"), and (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Soul_Locket.png)](/wiki/Soul_Locket "Soul Locket") [Soul Locket](/wiki/Soul_Locket "Soul Locket") are useless, as all heart pickups are replaced with flies.
