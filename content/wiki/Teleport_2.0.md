 # Teleport 2.0 ![image](/image/Teleport_2.0.png) 

Effects
---------


* Teleports Isaac to a room that has not been explored yet. Normal rooms are prioritized over special rooms, and common special rooms take priority over rarer ones.


Notes
-------


* The room that Isaac is teleported into will be touching an explored room, if possible.
* When used in a room with enemies in it, Isaac is teleported back into the same room, resetting it.
* The order of types of rooms is predetermined, first available on this list chosen:
	1. (Added in Afterbirth †) [Grave Room](/wiki/Grave_Room "Grave Room")
	2. Normal rooms
	3. (Added in Repentance) (Red Room) [Red Rooms](/wiki/Red_Room "Red Room") (opened but unexplored)
	4. (Boss Room) [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_Room "Boss Room")
	5. (Super Secret Room) [Super Secret Room](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room")
	6. (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop")
	7. (Treasure Room) [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room")
	8. (Sacrifice Room) [Sacrifice Room](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room")
	9. (Dice Room) [Dice Room](/wiki/Dice_Room "Dice Room")
	10. (Library) [Library](/wiki/Library "Library")
	11. (Curse Room) [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room")
	12. (Mini-Boss Room) [Mini-Boss Room](/wiki/Mini-Boss_Room "Mini-Boss Room")
	13. (Challenge Room) [Challenge Room](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room") / (Boss Challenge Room) [Boss Challenge Room](/wiki/Boss_Challenge_Room "Boss Challenge Room")
	14. (Clean Bedroom) [Clean Bedroom](/wiki/Clean_Bedroom "Clean Bedroom") / (Dirty Bedroom) [Dirty Bedroom](/wiki/Dirty_Bedroom "Dirty Bedroom")
	15. (Arcade) [Arcade](/wiki/Arcade "Arcade")
	16. (Vault) [Vault](/wiki/Vault "Vault")
	17. (Added in Repentance) (Planetarium) [Planetarium](/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium")
	18. (Secret Room) [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room")
	19. (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") / (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room")
	20. (Added in Repentance) (Ultra Secret Room) [Ultra Secret Room](/wiki/Ultra_Secret_Room "Ultra Secret Room") ([Mirrored World](/wiki/Mirrored_World "Mirrored World") only, even if it wasn't located)
	21. (I AM ERROR) [I AM ERROR](/wiki/I_AM_ERROR "I AM ERROR") room.
* In [(Cathedral)](/wiki/Cathedral "Cathedral") [Cathedral](/wiki/Cathedral "Cathedral") or [(Sheol)](/wiki/Sheol "Sheol") [Sheol](/wiki/Sheol "Sheol"), using the I AM ERROR room exit will bring Isaac to The Chest or Dark Room respectively.
	+ This works even if Isaac has the wrong corresponding item ([![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") / [![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative")) for that floor.
* In [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)"), [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room"), and (Added in Repentance) [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void"), Teleport 2.0 will teleport Isaac to the Devil/Angel room instead of the I AM ERROR room. The same is true when using it on the final floor of a [Daily Challenges](/wiki/Daily_Challenges "Daily Challenges").
* (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) In [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void"), using Teleport 2.0 in the I AM ERROR room will teleport Isaac to The Void again, allowing the floor to be restarted. The floor regenerates with new rooms and enemies. This can be done multiple times.
* (Added in Repentance) Using Teleport 2.0 in the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent") sequence will teleport Isaac to the Angel/Devil Room if all other rooms have been explored. After returning from the Angel/Devil Room, using the Teleport 2.0 again will teleport Isaac to the I AM ERROR room. If it's instead used without exploring any rooms, Isaac will be teleported to the 'starting' room of the floor containing the beam of light up to the next floor.
	+ This strategy also works in [(Home)](/wiki/Home "Home") [Home](/wiki/Home "Home"), taking Isaac to an Angel/Devil Room if all rooms have been explored. Isaac cannot use this to reach the hidden closet room containing Tainted characters, however. Using it after visiting the Angel/Devil Room will not teleport Isaac to the I AM ERROR room, and will instead merely teleport to the same Angel/Devil Room again.
* (Added in Repentance) Using Teleport 2.0 during the [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") fight will teleport Isaac to a random spot on the screen without interrupting the fight.
* (Added in Repentance) In the [Mirrored World](/wiki/Mirrored_World "Mirrored World"), Isaac will teleport to the (Ultra Secret Room) [Ultra Secret Room](/wiki/Ultra_Secret_Room "Ultra Secret Room") before the I AM ERROR room. Although it's empty like any other special room inside the Mirror, this can be useful to find the room in the normal world with [![image](/image/Red_Key.png)](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key") [Red Key](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key").
	+ If used again in the Mirrored World, Isaac will teleport to the (Red Room) **Red Room** which leads Isaac back to the main floor; if used once again, Isaac will teleport to the I AM ERROR room of the normal, non-mirrored floor.
* (Added in Repentance) After killing [(Mom's Heart)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") in [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") / [(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") II, Teleport 2.0 will teleport Isaac to the I AM ERROR room with hole leading to [(Corpse)](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse") [Corpse](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse"), even if there are unexplored rooms on the floor.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns flashing blue wisps on the middle ring. Tears have 20% chance of teleporting non-boss enemies to a random location in the current room on hit. Wisps also temporarily vanish every 5 seconds, preventing them from blocking shots or taking/dealing damage.
	+ This effect is identical to [![image](/image/Teleport!.png)](/wiki/Teleport! "Teleport!") [Teleport!](/wiki/Teleport! "Teleport!")'s effect with Book of Virtues, albeit with a 10% higher chance of teleporting enemies on hit.
