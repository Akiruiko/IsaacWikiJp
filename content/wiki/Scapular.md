 # Scapular ![image](/image/Scapular.png) 

Effects
---------


* Once per room, when Isaac is reduced to his last half [heart](/wiki/Heart "Heart") (either red, soul, or black), the aura around his head temporarily vanishes and he is granted one [Soul Heart](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart").
	+ After re-entering a room, the ability can be triggered again.
	+ With [Bone Hearts](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart"), the effect triggers on both half-filled and empty ones.


Notes
-------


* If the Scapular is active and Isaac is already at his last half heart, the effect won't trigger even on fatal damage.
* (Added in Afterbirth) Scapular does not charge between waves in [Greed mode](/wiki/Greed_mode "Greed mode"), though it can still be recharged by moving between rooms.
* Does not work with  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") or  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper"), as they cannot reach the required heart value.
* Reaching only half a heart remaining may be more difficult in [Chapter 4](/wiki/Chapters#Chapter_4 "Chapters") onwards, since all half-heart hits are upgraded to a full heart.
* (Added in Repentance) Damage sources that count as "health donation" no longer activate Scapular. This includes [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Machines#Blood_Donation_Machine "Machines"), [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Beggar#Devil_Beggar "Beggar"), [Hell Games](/wiki/Beggar#Hell_Game "Beggar"), [Confessionals](/wiki/Machines#Confessional "Machines"), [![image](/image/IV_Bag.png)](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") [IV Bag](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag"), [![image](/image/Razor_Blade.png)](/wiki/Razor_Blade "Razor Blade") [Razor Blade](/wiki/Razor_Blade "Razor Blade"), [![image](/image/Blood_Rights.png)](/wiki/Blood_Rights "Blood Rights") [Blood Rights](/wiki/Blood_Rights "Blood Rights"), (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Dull_Razor.png)](/wiki/Dull_Razor "Dull Razor") [Dull Razor](/wiki/Dull_Razor "Dull Razor"), [![image](/image/Sharp_Plug.png)](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug") [Sharp Plug](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug"), (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Shard_of_Glass.png)](/wiki/Shard_of_Glass "Shard of Glass") [Shard of Glass](/wiki/Shard_of_Glass "Shard of Glass"), (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Blood_Bombs.png)](/wiki/Blood_Bombs "Blood Bombs") [Blood Bombs](/wiki/Blood_Bombs "Blood Bombs"), and (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Blood_Oath.png)](/wiki/Blood_Oath "Blood Oath") [Blood Oath](/wiki/Blood_Oath "Blood Oath"). Sacrifice Rooms spikes still activate Scapular.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Cursed Skull)](/wiki/Cursed_Skull "Cursed Skull") [Cursed Skull](/wiki/Cursed_Skull "Cursed Skull"): Provided Scapular can always trigger, grants effective immortality, as the soul heart is always given before the teleport takes place.
	+ +[![image](/image/The_Wafer.png)](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer") [The Wafer](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer"): Grants true immortality, plus one hit on the soul heart, allowing the player to get hit once before teleporting.
