* The flame deals 23 damage per damage tick.
	+ The maximum damage dealt by a single flame is around 276, dealing damage roughly 6 times per second.
* The flame also destroys enemy shots it comes into contact with.
* The flame projectile can pass over pits, but can not travel through [rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks") or [poop](/wiki/Poops "Poops").

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Wisps are blue and only exist within the current room. For each activation of the candle, a new wisp is added for the duration of the blue flame. If the wisp stays after the flame disappears depends on the type of charge used to activate the blue flame: For a green charge, it only stays if the generated blue flame hit an enemy. For a blue charge, the wisp always stays. Wisps are reset to one if the blue flame does not hit an enemy. The wisps do not persist between rooms.
