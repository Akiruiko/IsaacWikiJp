 # The Gamekid ![image](/image/The_Gamekid.png) 


Effects
---------


Turns the character into a [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_(character) "wikipedia:Pac-Man (character)")-like creature for six seconds and provides the following effects:



* Gives [invulnerability](/wiki/Effects#Invulnerability "Effects").
* Inflicts [fear](/wiki/Fear "Fear") on all enemies.
* Removes the ability to shoot tears.
* Allows Isaac to deal 40 contact damage to enemies, at the rate of one hit per second per enemy.
* Replenishes a [(Half Red Heart)](/wiki/Half_Red_Heart "Half Red Heart") [Half Red Heart](/wiki/Half_Red_Heart "Half Red Heart") for every two enemies killed.


Notes
-------


* The invulnerability effect negates all forms of damage, including health loss from [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine") and [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_Beggar "Devil Beggar").
	+ This also negates damage from entering or exiting a (Curse Room) [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room"), but the effect is immediately removed upon walking through the door.
* Does not prevent [Red Heart container](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health") loss from [Health Down](/wiki/Health_Down "Health Down") pills or [Devil deals](/wiki/Devil_deal "Devil deal").
* This item is very similar to [![image](/image/My_Little_Unicorn.png)](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn") [My Little Unicorn](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn"), trading the extra speed for the ability to gain health from killing enemies.
* [Power Pill!](/wiki/Pills "Pills") has the same effect as The Gamekid, same goes with [(Cartridge)](/wiki/Cartridge "Cartridge") [Cartridge](/wiki/Cartridge "Cartridge") on getting hit.


Synergies

Wisps' tears have the [![image](/image/Anti-Gravity.png)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") effect and can inflict [fear](/wiki/Status_Effects "Status Effects") on enemies.
