 # Mom's Toenail ![image](/image/Mom%27s_Toenail.png) 

Effects
---------


* Mom's foot comes down every full minute (based on the in-game timer), dealing 300 damage.
	+ The foot also hurts Isaac for a full heart.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) As the foot counts as an explosion, the damage can be avoided with [(Pyromaniac)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") or (Added in Afterbirth)[(Host Hat)](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") [Host Hat](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat").
* Unlike the foot spawned by [(II - The High Priestess)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "II - The High Priestess") [II - The High Priestess](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") or (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[(Mom's Shovel)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Shovel "Mom's Shovel") [Mom's Shovel](/wiki/Mom%27s_Shovel "Mom's Shovel"), this foot doesn't target enemies nor Isaac.
* The impact can open doors, including [secret room](/wiki/Secret_room "Secret room") entrances.


Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | Because the position Mom's foot targets is random, it can land in the empty area of an L-shaped room.
