 # Lil Delirium ![image](/image/Lil_Delirium.png) 


Effects
---------


* Summons a ghost near Isaac that will follow him around, and summons a controllable blue crosshair. After a few seconds, the crosshair disappears, and the ghost will act depending on what the crosshair was targeting:
	+ [Items](/wiki/Items "Items") / [Pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") / [Trinkets](/wiki/Trinkets "Trinkets") / [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest "Chest") [Chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest") / [(Red Chest)](/wiki/Red_Chest "Red Chest") [Red Chests](/wiki/Red_Chest "Red Chest") / [(Spiked Chest)](/wiki/Spiked_Chest "Spiked Chest") [Spiked Chests](/wiki/Spiked_Chest "Spiked Chest") / (Added in Repentance) [(Mega Chest)](/wiki/Mega_Chest "Mega Chest") [Mega Chests](/wiki/Mega_Chest "Mega Chest"): Brings it to Isaac. Works in (Shop) [Shops](/wiki/Shop "Shop"), (Devil Room) [Devil Rooms](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") and (Black Market) [Black Markets](/wiki/Black_Market "Black Market") as well, making them effectively free. Stealing an item has a 50% chance to fail. If that happens, a buzzer sound will play out and the ghost will disappear without doing anything.
	+ [(Locked Chest)](/wiki/Locked_Chest "Locked Chest") [Locked Chests](/wiki/Locked_Chest "Locked Chest") / [(Eternal Chest)](/wiki/Eternal_Chest "Eternal Chest") [Eternal Chests](/wiki/Eternal_Chest "Eternal Chest") / [(Bomb Chest)](/wiki/Bomb_Chest "Bomb Chest") [Bomb Chests](/wiki/Bomb_Chest "Bomb Chest"): Opens the chest for free.
	+ [Buttons](/wiki/Buttons "Buttons"): Presses the button.
	+ [Enemies](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters"): Attacks the enemy until it dies or can no longer be targeted due to a form change or similar cause. The ghost does 3 damage per tick, for 9 damage per second.
	+ [Doors](/wiki/Rooms#special_rooms "Rooms"): Opens the door, even if it is locked. Functions the same as [![image](/image/Dad%27s_Key.png)](/wiki/Dad%27s_Key "Dad's Key") [Dad's Key](/wiki/Dad%27s_Key "Dad's Key") when being used in this way. This includes the door to [(Mega Satan)](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan"), exiting [(Hush)](/wiki/Hush "Hush") [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush")'s room, and exiting (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush").
		- (Added in Repentance) This does not work on [A Strange Door](/wiki/A_Strange_Door "A Strange Door"). However, it does work on doors leading to alternate path levels.
		- (Added in Repentance) This does not work on the flesh door leading to [(Mom's Heart)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") that appears after defeating [(Mom)](/wiki/Mom "Mom") [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom") in [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") or [(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna").
		- (Added in Repentance) This does not work on the hidden closet in [(Home)](/wiki/Home "Home") [Home](/wiki/Home "Home") to unlock the tainted characters.
	+ (Secret Room) [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") entrances: Explodes, opening the entrance.
	+ Destructible [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles"), [shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper"), [angel](/wiki/Angel "Angel") statues, [machines](/wiki/Machines "Machines"), and [beggars](/wiki/Beggar "Beggar"): Explodes and destroys them.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Stealing an item from a shop will restock it with another item. This happens even if Isaac does not have [![image](/image/Restock.png)](/wiki/Restock "Restock") [Restock](/wiki/Restock "Restock").
	+ (Added in Repentance) Stealing shop items will never restock them, even if Isaac **does** have [![image](/image/Restock.png)](/wiki/Restock "Restock") [Restock](/wiki/Restock "Restock"). This includes [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode").
	+ (Added in Repentance) Stealing from a black market will not restock items, as they work like devil deals.
* (Added in Repentance) Allows  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") to take more than one devil deal.
* If the crosshair is not targeting anything when the crosshair disappears, the ghost will interact with the object closest to the crosshair.
	+ This can be used to check for secret rooms on multiple walls at once.
* If the room has nothing to interact with, the ghost will disappear without doing anything.
* The ghost cannot pick up [(Sticky Nickel)](/wiki/Sticky_Nickel "Sticky Nickel") [Sticky Nickels](/wiki/Sticky_Nickel "Sticky Nickel") and will disappear upon touching them.
* The ghost can press the button in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode"), allowing waves to be stopped without taking damage.
* The ghost can open chests in (Challenge Room) [Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room") without triggering the room.
* Unlike chests, stealing an item pedestal from a (Challenge Room) [Challenge Room](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room") will trigger the waves to spawn upon picking up the stolen item.
* In rooms with multiple pedestal items where only one can be taken, if the ghost is carrying a pedestal while Isaac picks up a different pedestal item, the ghost will disappear. This prevents taking both items for free.
* Mr. Me can open the door to the [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") / [(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") without paying hearts.
* Using Mr. ME! with  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") does not work as displayed. Mr. ME! will not follow the crosshair, instead it will target where the Forgotten is thrown.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a wisp that looks like a face in the middle ring. The wisp cannot shoot. If the current room is cleared, the wisps automatically move toward and unlock [chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests") and special room doors, destroying themselves in the process. The wisps can open ANY locked doors, including the ones to [(Mega Satan)](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan"), the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent"), and [(Corpse)](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse") [Corpse](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse"). [(Bomb Chest)](/wiki/Bomb_Chest "Bomb Chest") [Bomb Chests](/wiki/Bomb_Chest "Bomb Chest") and [(Mega Chest)](/wiki/Mega_Chest "Mega Chest") [Mega Chests](/wiki/Mega_Chest "Mega Chest") are unaffected.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Does not increase the ghost's damage when attacking enemies.
* [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): May sometimes glitch pedestal items, resulting in Isaac being unable to pick them up without leaving and re-entering the room. Otherwise has no effect.
* [![image](/image/Sack_Head.png)](/wiki/Sack_Head "Sack Head") [Sack Head](/wiki/Sack_Head "Sack Head"): If Mr. ME! successfully stole a consumable from the shop, there is a chance he will drop a sack instead.


Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | If the (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") or (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") disappears after leaving it, using Mr. ME! will still attempt to unlock the doorway back to it. This allows you to move through the wall as if there were a door there, but you will not be able to enter the Devil Room or Angel Room.
 |




| (Bug) Bug!
 | (Removed in Repentance) If used while shooting with [![image](/image/Marked.png)](/wiki/Marked "Marked") [Marked](/wiki/Marked "Marked"), the crosshair will continue straight in the first direction Isaac shot at, and cannot be controlled until Marked is deactivated. |




| (Bug) Bug!
 | Mr. Me is able to damage [(Mom)](/wiki/Mom "Mom") [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom")'s doors even when no body part is sticking out of them, [(Mom's Heart)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") and [(It Lives)](/wiki/It_Lives "It Lives") [It Lives](/wiki/It_Lives "It Lives") while they're withdrawn, and [(Isaac)](/wiki/Isaac_(Boss)#Isaac "Isaac") [Isaac](/wiki/Isaac_(Boss)#Isaac "Isaac (Boss)") and (Added in Repentance) [(Hornfel)](/wiki/Hornfel "Hornfel") [Hornfel](/wiki/Hornfel "Hornfel") while they're off-screen. He never loses them as a valid target, eventually killing the boss.
