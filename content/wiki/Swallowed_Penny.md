 # Swallowed Penny ![image](/image/Swallowed_Penny.png) 

Effect
--------


* Spawns one [coin](/wiki/Coin "Coin") of any type upon taking damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) When held by  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"), spawns 0-1 coins.


Notes
-------


* Swallowed Penny can also be found by destroying [urns](/wiki/Rocks#Urns "Rocks") and [special shopkeepers](/wiki/Special_shopkeeper "Special shopkeeper").
* Though similar to the [(Piggy Bank)](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank") [Piggy Bank](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank") item, the Swallowed Penny is not limited to just pennies.
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) Unlike [(Piggy Bank)](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank") [Piggy Bank](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank"), playing as  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") with this trinket always drops a coin, allowing semi-infinite life.
	+ A trick for farming money when playing as Keeper is to find a room with some static hazard like spikes and taking damage, causing a coin to appear. A penny will only refill life while a nickel will give four cents, and a dime will give nine cents.
	+ This trick can also be used to survive multiple uses of a sacrifice room, healing with the dropped coin between each sacrifice.
	+ (Added in Repentance) As it can now give 0 coins when playing as the Keeper, this no longer works. When combined with [(Piggy Bank)](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank") [Piggy Bank](/wiki/Piggy_Bank "Piggy Bank"), you will still gain money on average, but you are no longer guaranteed a payout. Using [(IV Bag)](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") [IV Bag](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") as your source of damage increases the average amount of coins per damage to 1.5, meaning you can usually generate a pool of coins you can use during an unlucky break or for later healing.
