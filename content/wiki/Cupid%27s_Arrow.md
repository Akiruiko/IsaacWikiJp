Effects[]
---------


* Upon pickup, Isaac gets a small brown ringtail.
* After standing still and not pressing the move or attack buttons for one second, Isaac will turn into an invincible statue.
	+ Using bombs and active items will remove the invincibility state.
	+ Bombs can be placed while stationary and safely be stood on until they blow up if no other inputs are done after placing the bomb.


Notes[]
-------


* While invulnerable, Little Horn’s pitfall still affects Isaac and will teleport him throughout the room; however, the damage is not dealt.
* With items like [(Cube of Meat)](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") [Cube of Meat](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat"), Isaac can easily, but slowly, kill most enemies and bosses without taking any damage.


Synergies[]
-----------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(7 Seals)](/wiki/7_Seals "7 Seals") [7 Seals](/wiki/7_Seals "7 Seals"): One of the more versatile familiars that works with Gnawed Leaf. The varied forms and attacks of this familiar make it capable of clearing pretty much any room given time. The locusts it produces often fly to Isaac which takes care of chasing enemies, but its damaging creep and chasing attacks can reach even the farthest enemies.
* (Added in Repentance)[(120 Volt)](/wiki/120_Volt "120 Volt") [120 Volt](/wiki/120_Volt "120 Volt"): With enough damage, 120 Volt's zaps becomes far more efficient at killing than orbitals.
	+ At 15 damage minimum, it surpasses most orbitals.
	+ At 30 damage or more, it surpasses [(Sacrificial Dagger)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Dagger "Sacrificial Dagger") [Sacrificial Dagger](/wiki/Sacrificial_Dagger "Sacrificial Dagger").
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Angry Fly)](/wiki/Angry_Fly "Angry Fly") [Angry Fly](/wiki/Angry_Fly "Angry Fly"): Aggressively attacks enemies even if they're far away, but can end up harmlessly orbiting slow or stationary enemies indefinitely, or trying to attack invulnerable enemies. It does better with slow or stationary bosses than regular enemies, diving in to attack periodically instead of harmlessly orbiting.
* [(Daddy Longlegs)](/wiki/Daddy_Longlegs "Daddy Longlegs") [Daddy Longlegs](/wiki/Daddy_Longlegs "Daddy Longlegs"): Allows Isaac to easily clear most rooms or bosses while in statue form. Daddy Longlegs cannot damage bosses like (Added in Repentance) [(The Shell)](/wiki/The_Shell "The Shell") [The Shell](/wiki/The_Shell "The Shell") and won't target enemies that are a long distance from Isaac.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Damocles)](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles") [Damocles](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles"): If Isaac is in statue form when the sword falls, he will survive.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Dark Arts)](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts") [Dark Arts](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts"): While Isaac is surrounded by enemies, he will not take damage and will safely go into the shadow state. (Even if enemies are in pointblank range.)
* (Added in Repentance)[(Decap Attack)](/wiki/Decap_Attack "Decap Attack") [Decap Attack](/wiki/Decap_Attack "Decap Attack"): The head can be used on stationary bosses to wither them down.
* [(E. Coli)](/wiki/E._Coli "E. Coli") [E. Coli](/wiki/E._Coli "E. Coli") /[(Midas' Touch)](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") [Midas' Touch](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") /(Added in Afterbirth)[(Serpent's Kiss)](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") [Serpent's Kiss](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") / [(The Virus)](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus") [The Virus](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus"): Monsters touching the statue will be affected without Isaac taking collision damage.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Empty Vessel)](/wiki/Empty_Vessel "Empty Vessel") [Empty Vessel](/wiki/Empty_Vessel "Empty Vessel"): if Empty Vessel's requirement is fulfilled, Isaac can safely wait for the shield to activate, allowing to deal damage without leaving invulnerability.
* (Added in Repentance)[(IBS)](/wiki/IBS "IBS") [IBS](/wiki/IBS "IBS"): Orbitals and other things(such as 120 Volt) can trigger IBS while in statue form, however, Isaac will still be invincible. This can be really good if a Stinky Poop is held above his head.
* [(Kamikaze!)](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!") [Kamikaze!](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!"): Statue form will break, but the initial explosion will not damage Isaac, therefore granting Isaac quasi-unlimited bombs.
* [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): The hovering tear will still deal damage and the statue form won't break as long as the attack buttons aren't being pressed.
	+ **The Ludovico Technique** + [(Strange Attractor)](/wiki/Strange_Attractor "Strange Attractor") [Strange Attractor](/wiki/Strange_Attractor "Strange Attractor"): Can pull enemies in while remaining a statue, clearing out rooms easily.
* [(Mom's Knife)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): The knife can damage enemies while Isaac is a statue.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Mom's Heels)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heels "Mom's Heels") [Mom's Heels](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heels "Mom's Heels"): While invincible, Isaac can still deal contact damage.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Monstrance)](/wiki/Monstrance "Monstrance") [Monstrance](/wiki/Monstrance "Monstrance"): The aura makes quick work of chasing enemies.
* [(The Pinking Shears)](/wiki/The_Pinking_Shears "The Pinking Shears") [The Pinking Shears](/wiki/The_Pinking_Shears "The Pinking Shears"): Isaac's body will attack enemies while his head is invincible.
* [(Placenta)](/wiki/Placenta "Placenta") [Placenta](/wiki/Placenta "Placenta"): Isaac can safely regenerate Red Hearts in any room, making it easy to have enough health from any mistake at the cost of time.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Salvation)](/wiki/Salvation "Salvation") [Salvation](/wiki/Salvation "Salvation"): The aura can trigger from nearby enemies while Isaac is safely a statue, and the damaging beams when this happens can reach farther enemies. This powerful attack can make quick work of bosses that chase Isaac.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Spin to Win)](/wiki/Spin_to_Win "Spin to Win") [Spin to Win](/wiki/Spin_to_Win "Spin to Win"): Gnawed Leaf will activate while using Spin to Win, as long as Isaac is stationary. This allows for a brief moment of high damage against enemies that chase Isaac.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Sprinkler)](/wiki/Sprinkler "Sprinkler") [Sprinkler](/wiki/Sprinkler "Sprinkler"): Can be placed upon entering a room, and will continue to fire when Isaac is invincible, meaning any room can be cleared without the risk of Isaac taking damage. This theoretically allows end-game bosses to be beaten without having to move.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Super Magnet)](/wiki/Super_Magnet "Super Magnet") [Super Magnet](/wiki/Super_Magnet "Super Magnet"): Pulls enemies into Isaac, can be extremely powerful if combined with orbitals that allow contact damage.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene"): Tainted Magdalene's "Hug" attack still triggers when in the statue state without taking damage, making short work of aggressive enemies as well as providing lots of healing.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"): The Soul is invincible as long as the bone club is not used and The Forgotten is not thrown, even if The Soul is holding The Forgotten and moving around. Combined with orbitals that deal contact damage like [(Cube of Meat)](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") [Cube of Meat](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") or items that can trigger damage only by movement such as (Added in Repentance)[(Purgatory)](/wiki/Purgatory "Purgatory") [Purgatory](/wiki/Purgatory "Purgatory"), can make for a trivial method to beat any boss.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Yes Mother?)](/wiki/Yes_Mother%3F "Yes Mother?") [Yes Mother?](/wiki/Yes_Mother%3F "Yes Mother?"): When worst comes to worst and Isaac has no orbitals or familiars, the knife can be used to deal damage, due to how common the transformation is.


Interactions[]
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[(2Spooky)](/wiki/2Spooky "2Spooky") [2Spooky](/wiki/2Spooky "2Spooky"): Counterintuitive and should be avoided, as most enemies will never approach orbital range.
