 # The Sad Onion ![image](/image/The_Sad_Onion.png) 


Effects
---------


* New item pedestals cycle very quickly between 5 random items.
	+ The 5 items will cycle in the same order every loop.
	+ Items are rerolled at a rate of once every 0.2 seconds.
	+ Plot-related items (i.e [![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid")/[![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative"), [![image](/image/Broken_Shovel.png)](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel") [Broken Shovel](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel")/[![image](/image/Broken_Shovel.png)](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel") [Broken Shovel](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel"), [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_1.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") [Knife Piece 1](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1")/[![image](/image/Knife_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2"), etc.) are unaffected by Glitched Crown.


Notes
-------


* One of the items will be the initial one spawned/rerolled, while the other four will be from the [item pool](/wiki/Item_pool "Item pool") of the room the item is in.
* Items spawned from [chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests") normally have a small delay between when they spawn and when Isaac can pick them up; if Isaac has Glitched Crown, this delay is removed and he can pick up the item the moment it spawns, effectively forcing him to get a random item.
	+ Chests have to be lightly tapped and immediately walked away from to avoid accidentally picking up the item so Glitched Crown can be used properly.
* [(Tainted Isaac)](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac")'s inherent ability is overridden by this effect.
* If obtained during the [![image](/image/Genesis.png)](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") [Genesis](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") item sequence, the effect will start on the second item after grabbing Glitched Crown.
* Items seen as options count the same way as items normally seen. This essentially depletes item pools at 5x rate.
* A good strategy to get the item you want is to remember the one that becomes before it in the cycle. Stand as close to the pedestal as you can and when you see the item that comes before the desired item move towards the pedestal.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Binge_Eater.png)](/wiki/Binge_Eater "Binge Eater") [Binge Eater](/wiki/Binge_Eater "Binge Eater"): adds a random food item to the cycle, for a total of 6 items on the cycling pedestal. Only the pedestals generated after picking up Binge Eater will be affected.
