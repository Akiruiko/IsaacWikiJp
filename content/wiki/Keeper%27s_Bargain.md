	+ Items affected by Keeper's Bargain may occasionally be discounted (e.g. a 30 coins item down to 15 coins), just like items are in a regular shop.
	+ No effect on  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") or  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost").


Notes
-------

* Dropping this item while in the room disables its effect.
