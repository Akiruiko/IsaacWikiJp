Effects
---------


* Halves shop prices.


Notes
-------

* [Items](/wiki/Item "Item") sold for 15 pennies will have their price reduced to 7.
* [Pickups](/wiki/Pickup "Pickup") sold for 5 pennies will have their price reduced to 3. Red hearts, normally sold for 3 pennies, will have their price reduced to 2.

	+ (Removed in Afterbirth) Multiple Steam Sales have no effect.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) After obtaining 2 Steam Sales, all shop prices are set to 0 coins.
		- If Isaac has [![image](/image/Restock.png)](/wiki/Restock "Restock") [Restock](/wiki/Restock "Restock"), it is possible to collect an infinite supply of pickups/items. Extremely powerful when combined with [![image](/image/Chaos.png)](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos") [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos").
	+ (Added in Repentance) Multiple Steam Sales only further reduce prices, with each additional copy lowering prices less.
		- The price is lowered to ({\displaystyle {\frac {price}{n+1}}}), where *n* is the number of Steam Sales.
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Afterbirth â€ ) Steam Sale will cause the [Deals with the Devil](/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil "Deal with the Devil") not to convert the type of required heart automatically.
* (Added in Repentance) Prevents shops from having natural discounts on top of the Steam Sale discount.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Adoption Papers)](/wiki/Adoption_Papers "Adoption Papers") [Adoption Papers](/wiki/Adoption_Papers "Adoption Papers"): Both of the discounts stack, selling familiars for 5 cents.
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Diplopia.png)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia"): Can be used to create two Steam Sales, reducing the price of all items in the shop to 0.
	+ **Diplopia** + [![image](/image/Restock.png)](/wiki/Restock "Restock") [Restock](/wiki/Restock "Restock") or [Greed mode](/wiki/Greed_mode "Greed mode"): Restock will allow shop items to replenish indefinitely, so by having multiple Steam Sales by the methods above, infinite items may be purchased. Be careful not to pick up [![image](/image/Missing_No..png)](/wiki/Missing_No. "Missing No.") [Missing No.](/wiki/Missing_No. "Missing No."), which will remove the Steam Sales and will likely replace many items with [![image](/image/Breakfast.png)](/wiki/Breakfast "Breakfast") [Breakfast](/wiki/Breakfast "Breakfast").
* (Added in Repentance) [![image](/image/Diplopia.png)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia"): Each additional Steam Sale will further reduce the price of all items in the shop, down to a minimum of 1 cent.
