 # Big Fan ![image](/image/Big_Fan.png) 


Effects
---------


* Spawns a large [orbital familiar](/wiki/Orbital_familiar "Orbital familiar") that blocks enemy shots and deals 2 damage per tick (10 damage per second) on contact.
* This item belongs to the [Beelzebub](/wiki/Beelzebub "Beelzebub") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a giant humanoid fly.


Notes
-------


* The Big Fan is the largest of the orbital familiars, but also deals the least damage. (Added in Afterbirth †) Its contact damage is tied with (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Bloodshot_Eye.png)](/wiki/Bloodshot_Eye "Bloodshot Eye") [Bloodshot Eye](/wiki/Bloodshot_Eye "Bloodshot Eye") and its position of the lowest contact damage has been usurped by (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Mom%27s_Razor.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Razor "Mom's Razor") [Mom's Razor](/wiki/Mom%27s_Razor "Mom's Razor") while Isaac's damage stat is low.
* The Big Fan has lower rotational speed than other familiars (similar to [Blue Flies](/wiki/Blue_Fly "Blue Fly")).
* The Big Fan orbits independently rather than occupying one of the three defense orbital slots.
* Affects the speed of all other orbitals, slowing them down a lot (NOTE: This effect does not happen until you get a new orbital after Big Fan).
* Horse pill versions of the Pretty Fly [pill](/wiki/Pills "Pills") spawn a Big Fan without granting it as an item. Big Fans acquired this way spin at normal pace and don't affect rotation speed of other orbitals.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") / (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Hive_Mind.png)](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind") [Hive Mind](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind"): Big Fan becomes visually larger and deals more damage. Collision radius is not increased, however.


Interactions
--------------


* [Orbital familiars](/wiki/Orbital_familiar "Orbital familiar"): If Big Fan is the first orbital obtained, subsequent familiars will match its low speed. (Removed in Afterbirth †) This excludes Pretty Flies.
