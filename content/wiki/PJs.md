Effects[]
---------


* Upon taking damage a certain number of times, Isaac gains a permanent demonic [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar"). Possible familiars include:
	+ [(Dark Bum)](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum") [Dark Bum](/wiki/Dark_Bum "Dark Bum")
	+ [(Demon Baby)](/wiki/Demon_Baby "Demon Baby") [Demon Baby](/wiki/Demon_Baby "Demon Baby")
	+ [(Incubus)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus")
	+ [(Leech)](/wiki/Leech "Leech") [Leech](/wiki/Leech "Leech")
	+ [(Lil Brimstone)](/wiki/Lil_Brimstone "Lil Brimstone") [Lil Brimstone](/wiki/Lil_Brimstone "Lil Brimstone")
	+ [(Succubus)](/wiki/Succubus "Succubus") [Succubus](/wiki/Succubus "Succubus")
	+ (Added in Repentance)[(Lil Abaddon)](/wiki/Lil_Abaddon "Lil Abaddon") [Lil Abaddon](/wiki/Lil_Abaddon "Lil Abaddon")
	+ (Added in Repentance)[(Twisted Pair)](/wiki/Twisted_Pair "Twisted Pair") [Twisted Pair](/wiki/Twisted_Pair "Twisted Pair")
* The first and second familiars will each spawn after taking damage 15 times. The third and fourth familiars will each spawn after taking damage 30 more times. No further familiars will spawn. As a result, after taking damage 90 times, four out of eight possible familiars will have spawned.
* Isaac will look progressively more pregnant as he takes damage.


Notes[]
-------


* [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") starts with this item by default, even if it hasn't been unlocked. Lilith can get a second [(Incubus)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") through this.
* Only one of each type of familiar can be spawned.
* Familiars that have yet to be unlocked can still spawn.
* Only actually getting damage counts towards the payout. For example, negating damage with the [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") will not count.
* Familiars spawned this way do not count towards [transformations](/wiki/Transformation "Transformation") nor the [collection page](/wiki/Collection_page "Collection page").
* Familiars spawned by the item do not affect item pools, so multiple copies of one familiar can be obtained. For example, a second Incubus can be purchased after Cambion Conception spawns one.
* If a familiar obtained is a copy of another one already obtained, using [(Box of Friends)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") will only clone one of that familiar.
* (Added in Repentance) If this item is removed with [(XVII - The Stars?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XVII - The Stars?") [XVII - The Stars?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), it will also remove any familiars already obtained through Cambion Conception.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Caffeine Pill)](/wiki/Caffeine_Pill "Caffeine Pill") [Caffeine Pill](/wiki/Caffeine_Pill "Caffeine Pill"): Makes it impossible to tell how far along the pregnancy is.
