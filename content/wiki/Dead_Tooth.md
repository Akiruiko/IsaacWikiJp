 # Dead Tooth ![image](/image/Dead_Tooth.png) 


Effects
---------


* Grants charged tears which fires a tight burst of shots, shooting up to four shots when fully charged. Firing mid-charge will shoot fewer tears depending on the charge time.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The full burst size is five shots.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Quickly tapping the fire key will result in no tears being fired.
	+ Charging while a burst is currently firing will prevent the rest of the shots from being fired.
* Taking damage while charging (not fully charged) will teleport Isaac into another room.


Notes
-------


* This item can be counterproductive, especially while fighting bosses, as getting hit while charging a shot will reset the fight.
* The teleport effect only occurs when taking damage while in the middle of charging, before the shot is fully charged. Having a high tears stat for faster charging will decrease the window where Isaac is vulnerable to teleporting.
* (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) The teleporting and charge-up effects do not apply to  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith"). Her Incubus will fire three projectiles with each shot without needing to charge, tripling her damage output with no downside.
* Isaac is unable to fire tears if he hits 30+ TPS with this item.
* The color of Isaac's cursed eye will indicate what state it currently is in:
	+ White: Inactive
	+ Black: Charging up
	+ Flashing black and white: Fully charged
