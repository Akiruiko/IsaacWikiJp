Notes[]
-------


* (Removed in Afterbirth †) If this item is triggered in the [(Flooded Caves)](/wiki/Flooded_Caves "Flooded Caves") [Flooded Caves](/wiki/Flooded_Caves "Flooded Caves"), there is a chance that the black charger will be replaced by a [Drowned Charger](/wiki/Drowned_Charger "Drowned Charger"). The summoned Drowned Charger will behave like normal black chargers, and upon death will explode into 4 blood shots that do not damage the player.
* Shadows of incoming attacks from above will be harder to see, as they're covered by the item's shadow initially.
* This item can only spawn a maximum of 5 chargers.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(BFFS!)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): No effect.
* [(Box of Friends)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends"): No effect.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Eraser)](/wiki/Eraser "Eraser") [Eraser](/wiki/Eraser "Eraser"): Erasing a [Charger](/wiki/Charger "Charger") will prevent all newly created [friendly](/wiki/Friendly "Friendly") Chargers from spawning, rendering the item useless. The item spawns a normal Charger before changing it to the special My Shadow variant.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Ghost Bombs)](/wiki/Ghost_Bombs "Ghost Bombs") [Ghost Bombs](/wiki/Ghost_Bombs "Ghost Bombs") / (Added in Repentance)[(Purgatory)](/wiki/Purgatory "Purgatory") [Purgatory](/wiki/Purgatory "Purgatory"): Explosions from the ghosts can and will kill the chargers.

(Added in Afterbirth)
The dark [friendly](/wiki/Friendly "Friendly") chargers act like normal chargers and will charge at enemies when they have a chance. They will attack enemies until they run out of hp either from contact with enemies or hazards (e.g. [spikes](/wiki/Spikes "Spikes") or [Fireplace](/wiki/Fireplace "Fireplace")).



### Notes[]


* The allied chargers are affected by mass slowdown effects from items such as the [(Stop Watch)](/wiki/Stop_Watch "Stop Watch") [Stop Watch](/wiki/Stop_Watch "Stop Watch"), granting the Shadow Chargers a disadvantage.
* (Removed in Repentance) If Isaac has [homing tears](/wiki/Homing_tears "Homing tears"), they will home in on allied chargers.
* The allied chargers will take damage from any sort of explosion, (Added in Afterbirth †) except from your own general explosions, (Removed in Repentance) though certain synergies involving [(Scatter Bombs)](/wiki/Scatter_Bombs "Scatter Bombs") [Scatter Bombs](/wiki/Scatter_Bombs "Scatter Bombs") may kill the Friendly charger.
* (Removed in Afterbirth †) With [(Punching Bag)](/wiki/Punching_Bag "Punching Bag") [Punching Bag](/wiki/Punching_Bag "Punching Bag"), the allied chargers may attack the Punching Bag instead of enemies. It is recommended you don't take these two items together as they don't synergize well.
