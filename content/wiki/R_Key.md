 # R Key ![image](/image/R_Key.png) 

Effects
---------


* Returns Isaac to the beginning of the run in [Chapter 1](/wiki/Chapter_1 "Chapter 1"), with all [stat](/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") boosts, [items](/wiki/Items "Items"), [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups"), and [trinkets](/wiki/Trinkets "Trinkets") intact (similar to [Victory Lap](/wiki/Victory_Lap "Victory Lap")).


Notes
-------


* (Angel Room) [Angel Rooms](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") once again become possible to appear even if the player has made a previous [devil deal](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room").
* The chance for a (Planetarium) [Planetarium](/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium") to appear can once again be increased above 1% without a [(Telescope Lens)](/wiki/Telescope_Lens "Telescope Lens") [Telescope Lens](/wiki/Telescope_Lens "Telescope Lens"), even if the player has previously entered a Planetarium.
* If the [Donation Machine](/wiki/Donation_Machine "Donation Machine") was jammed before usage, it will no longer be jammed.
* If used in a run while achievements and character unlocks are enabled, they will still be enabled after use. Similarly, if these are disabled because the player is in a [Victory Lap](/wiki/Victory_Lap "Victory Lap") or seeded run, they will remain disabled after use.
* The timer and score do NOT reset.
	+ This means that the timer requirements to access (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush"), [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)"), and [![image](/image/Broken_Shovel.png)](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel") [Broken Shovel](/wiki/Broken_Shovel "Broken Shovel") do NOT reset.
* Item pools are NOT reset.
* The 13 pill pool does NOT reset, unlike with a victory lap.
* [![image](/image/Key_Piece_1.png)](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1") [Key Piece 1](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1") and [![image](/image/Key_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Key_Piece_2 "Key Piece 2") [Key Piece 2](/wiki/Key_Piece_2 "Key Piece 2") may also be obtained again, even if already consumed in [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)") or [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") to unlock [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan")'s door.
* [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_1.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") [Knife Piece 1](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") and [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") may also be obtained again.
* When used in [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent") or [(Home)](/wiki/Home "Home") [Home](/wiki/Home "Home"), Isaac will instead be sent to the Ascent version of Chapter 1. However, the run will restart from there (the ascent sequence ends when R Key is used).
* In scenarios where R Key can be purchased, it uniquely costs 99 [coins](/wiki/Coins "Coins") instead of 15.
	+ This rule does not apply to the extra shop created by [![image](/image/Member_Card.png)](/wiki/Member_Card "Member Card") [Member Card](/wiki/Member_Card "Member Card").
* If [![image](/image/Sprinkler.png)](/wiki/Sprinkler "Sprinkler") [Sprinkler](/wiki/Sprinkler "Sprinkler") is used on the final room in greed mode and the R Key is used, the sprinkler/s will come with Isaac to the starting room.
* In Greed mode, this costs 99 coins.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Will spawn a single, normal wisp.
* [(Broken Remote)](/wiki/Broken_Remote "Broken Remote") [Broken Remote](/wiki/Broken_Remote "Broken Remote"): Isaac will start on a random room on the first floor. This combo can also lead to a game crash.
