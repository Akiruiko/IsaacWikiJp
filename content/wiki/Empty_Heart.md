Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Sacred Heart is a [special item](/wiki/Special_item "Special item").
* Sacred Heart has the highest damage multiplier of all passive items.
* The flat damage gained by Sacred Heart is not affected by its damage multiplier. However, other flat damage upgrades (such as those gained by [(Curved Horn)](/wiki/Curved_Horn "Curved Horn") [Curved Horn](/wiki/Curved_Horn "Curved Horn") or (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void")) will be affected normally.
* (Removed in Repentance) Although Sacred Heart increases range, the reduction of shot speed results in a slight decrease in effective range, not accounting for homing.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The item no longer decreases range, as shot speed no longer affects effective range.
