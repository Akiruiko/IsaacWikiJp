 # Tooth and Nail ![image](/image/Tooth_and_Nail.png) 

Effects
---------


* Every 6 seconds, Isaac turns to stone and sprouts spikes for 1 second. While Isaac is in this state, he is immune to damage and deals 40 contact damage.
	+ Isaac flashes white four times before turning to stone on the fourth flash. The first three flashes are accompanied by a "ticking" sound, the final one with the spike extension sound of a mimic chest.
	+ Unlike [![image](/image/Gnawed_Leaf.png)](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf") [Gnawed Leaf](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf"), Isaac can still move and shoot tears.

* When under the effects of the [Paralysis pill](/wiki/Pills#Paralysis "Pills") Isaac cannot change into a statue.


Synergies
-----------


* Contact damage items work great with Tooth and Nail, such as [![image](/image/Aries.png)](/wiki/Aries "Aries") [Aries](/wiki/Aries "Aries") / [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Heels.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heels "Mom's Heels") [Mom's Heels](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heels "Mom's Heels") / [![image](/image/The_Virus.png)](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus") [The Virus](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus") for extra damage, [![image](/image/Serpent%27s_Kiss.png)](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") [Serpent's Kiss](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") for Black Heart generation, [![image](/image/Midas%27_Touch.png)](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") [Midas' Touch](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") for coin generation etc.
* [![image](/image/Damocles.png)](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles") [Damocles](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles"): As Isaac is invincible 1/6th of the time, with some luck, Tooth and Nail may save him from the falling sword.
* [![image](/image/Kamikaze!.png)](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!") [Kamikaze!](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!"): Allows usage without taking damage during invincibility.
* [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") can use this item to prevent additional damage from occurring after losing the [![image](/image/Holy_Mantle.png)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") (for example, exiting a (Curse Room) [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") after being hit), and it does not use up the Holy Mantle's 1-hit protection if it has not been lost.
