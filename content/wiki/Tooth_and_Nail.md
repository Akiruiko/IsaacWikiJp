Effects[]
---------


* Every 6 seconds, Isaac turns to stone and sprouts spikes for 1 second. While Isaac is in this state, he is immune to damage and deals 40 contact damage.
	+ Isaac flashes white four times before turning to stone on the fourth flash. The first three flashes are accompanied by a "ticking" sound, the final one with the spike extension sound of a mimic chest.
	+ Unlike [(Gnawed Leaf)](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf") [Gnawed Leaf](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf"), Isaac can still move and shoot tears.

* [(Blood Donation Machine.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/6/6e/Blood_Donation_Machine.png/revision/latest?cb=20210821075842) [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Machines#Blood_Donation_Machine "Machines") and [(Devil Beggar.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/b/b6/Devil_Beggar.png/revision/latest?cb=20210821101216) [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Beggar#Devil_Beggar "Beggar") will still deal damage while Tooth and Nail is active.
* With proper timing, (Curse Room) [Curse Rooms](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") can be both entered and exited without taking damage.
* When invincible, Mimic Chests can be opened without taking damage.
* When under the effects of the [Paralysis pill](/wiki/Pills#Paralysis "Pills") Isaac cannot change into a statue.


Synergies[]
-----------


* Contact damage items work great with Tooth and Nail, such as [(Aries)](/wiki/Aries "Aries") [Aries](/wiki/Aries "Aries") / [(Mom's Heels)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heels "Mom's Heels") [Mom's Heels](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heels "Mom's Heels") / [(The Virus)](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus") [The Virus](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus") for extra damage, [(Serpent's Kiss)](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") [Serpent's Kiss](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") for Black Heart generation, [(Midas' Touch)](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") [Midas' Touch](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") for coin generation etc.
* [(Damocles)](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles") [Damocles](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles"): As Isaac is invincible 1/6th of the time, with some luck, Tooth and Nail may save him from the falling sword.
* [(Kamikaze!)](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!") [Kamikaze!](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!"): Allows usage without taking damage during invincibility.
* [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") can use this item to prevent additional damage from occurring after losing the [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") (for example, exiting a (Curse Room) [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") after being hit), and it does not use up the Holy Mantle's 1-hit protection if it has not been lost.
