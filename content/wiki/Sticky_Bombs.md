 # Sticky Bombs ![image](/image/Sticky_Bombs.png) 


Effects
---------


* Pickups (e.g. hearts, coins, keys, bombs, etc.) are attracted to Isaac.
	+ The attraction enables the item to pass/fly over pits or rocks, but not through Key Blocks.
	+ [Hearts](/wiki/Hearts "Hearts") are only attracted if Isaac could pick them up with his existing Red Heart containers.
	+ [Batteries](/wiki/Batteries "Batteries") act similarly to hearts in that they will only be attracted to Isaac if his active item isn't fully charged.
	+ (Added in Repentance) [Chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest") roughly 2 or fewer tiles away from Isaac open automatically. Spiked chests are opened without damaging Isaac. Locked chests and stone chests are not opened and still require a key/bomb.
* A few enemies (like the [Horf](/wiki/Horf "Horf")) are drawn toward Isaac as well.


Notes
-------


* Magneto can attract (Added in Afterbirth â€ ) [Scared Hearts](/wiki/Scared_Heart "Scared Heart"), but they still run away from Isaac.
* (Added in Repentance) [Sacks](/wiki/Sacks "Sacks") are not attracted nor opened by Magneto.
* (Added in Repentance) If Magneto opens the chests in (Challenge Room) [Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room"), the waves won't start spawning, nor the way out will be closed.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Hypercoagulation.png)](/wiki/Hypercoagulation "Hypercoagulation") [Hypercoagulation](/wiki/Hypercoagulation "Hypercoagulation"): Magneto cuts the momentum of the hearts, allowing for easy pickup and, in turn, making Isaac very tough to kill.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Options%3F.png)](/wiki/Options%3F "Options?") [Options?](/wiki/Options%3F "Options?"): If a chest is presented as a choice and opened by Magneto, the other reward won't disappear unless the empty chest is then touched. Chests with items disappear or make the other reward disappear, though.
* [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene")/ [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"): Attracts hearts and coins dropped by enemies, allowing for an easier survival and/or coin mongering respectively.
