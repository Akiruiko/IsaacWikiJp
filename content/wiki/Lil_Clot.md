 # Lil Clot ![image](/image/Lil_Clot.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns a [(Sumptorium)](/wiki/Sumptorium "Sumptorium") [Sumptorium](/wiki/Sumptorium "Sumptorium") blood clot [Familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") on the ground next to Isaac. This familiar moves and shoots through the same inputs as Isaac, effectively acting as a second source of tears.
* The familiar uses Isaac's [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears"), [range](/wiki/Range "Range"), [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed"), and [tear effects](/wiki/Tear_effects "Tear effects"), and deals 0.35x Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
* Lil Clot will die after it gets hit 3 times, and will respawn when entering a new room.


Notes
-------


* Holding the "drop" button lets Isaac move independently from Lil Clot.
* Lil Clot will persist after the trinket is dropped, but it will not respawn unless the trinket is picked up again.
* Lil Clot spawns in a random location near Isaac when the trinket is first picked up.
* Duplicating Lil Clot trinkets will cause them to stack, allowing Isaac to control multiple Lil Clots at once.


Synergies
-----------


* [(BFFS!)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Increases the damage to 70% of Isaac's.
* [![image](/image/Found_Soul.png)](/wiki/Found_Soul "Found Soul") [Found Soul](/wiki/Found_Soul "Found Soul"): The ghost familiar receives its own floating Lil Clot that acts the same way as Isaac's, vanishing when the ghost dies.
* [(Golden Trinket)](/wiki/Golden_Trinket "Golden Trinket") [Golden Trinket](/wiki/Golden_Trinket "Golden Trinket") / [(Mom's Box)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box") [Mom's Box](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box"): Summons an additional Lil Clot.
* [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): The clot's tear floats the same way Isaac's tear does. Additional clots gained from Mom's box, Found Soul, and golden versions of the trinket will have an additional floating tear.
* [(Tractor Beam)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): Lil Clot's tears travel along the beam regardless of the location of Lil Clot.
