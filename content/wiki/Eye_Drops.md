Effects[]
---------


* Decreases the [tear delay](/wiki/Tear_delay "Tear delay") of tears fired from Isaac's left eye by ~28%.
	+ The difference in fire rates causes Isaac's tears to be fired at a staggered rate.
	+ The first shot in a while is always a double shot.


Notes[]
-------


* Every type of attack that does not use both of Isaac's eyes benefits from the fire rate up, but will not have staggered attack rate. These include, for example:
	+ All charged attacks such as [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") and [(Monstro's Lung)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung").
	+ All tear replacers such as [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") and [(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology").
	+ All one-eyed characters and item effects, such as  [(Cain)](/wiki/Cain "Cain") [Cain](/wiki/Cain "Cain") and [(Stapler)](/wiki/Stapler "Stapler") [Stapler](/wiki/Stapler "Stapler").
	+ Attacking via familiars, such as [(Incubus)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") and  [(Tainted Lilith)](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith") [Tainted Lilith](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith").
* Multi-shot attacks such as [(20/20)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") and [(Mutant Spider)](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") [Mutant Spider](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") *do* have staggered firing.
* The effectiveness of this item increases with Isaacâ€™s tears stat, but not with items that directly decrease tear delay.
