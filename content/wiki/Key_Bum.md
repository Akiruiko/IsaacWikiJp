 # Key Bum ![image](/image/Key_Bum.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns a familiar that follows Isaac around and collects keys, dropping random [Chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest") in return. (He does not fill up a familiar "slot".)
* This item belongs to the [Super Bum](/wiki/Super_Bum "Super Bum") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac's bums into Super Bum.


Notes
-------


* Key Bum will not pick up [(Golden Key)](/wiki/Golden_Key "Golden Key") [Golden Keys](/wiki/Golden_Key "Golden Key").
* (Added in Afterbirth â€  / Removed in Repentance) Key Bum will pick up [(Charged Key)](/wiki/Charged_Key "Charged Key") [Charged Keys](/wiki/Charged_Key "Charged Key") without additional benefit.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Key Bum will leave a [(Lil' Battery)](/wiki/Lil%27_Battery "Lil' Battery") [Lil' Battery](/wiki/Lil%27_Battery "Lil' Battery") behind when picking up [(Charged Key)](/wiki/Charged_Key "Charged Key") [Charged Keys](/wiki/Charged_Key "Charged Key").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Familiar is bigger and drops chests more often.
* [(Flat Penny)](/wiki/Flat_Penny "Flat Penny") [Flat Penny](/wiki/Flat_Penny "Flat Penny"): Chests frequently contain pennies, which have a chance of spawning more keys for Key Bum to pick up, possibly lead to a loop.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Gilded Key)](/wiki/Gilded_Key "Gilded Key") [Gilded Key](/wiki/Gilded_Key "Gilded Key") / [(The Left Hand)](/wiki/The_Left_Hand "The Left Hand") [The Left Hand](/wiki/The_Left_Hand "The Left Hand"): Works as expected.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Eye.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye") [Guppy's Eye](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye"): Allows Isaac to choose which Locked Chests are worth opening and which to pass, thus saving keys. Great for min-maxing.
