Effects[]
---------


* Chains down the nearest enemy, completely preventing them from acting for 5 seconds.
	+ This effect works on enemies that are invulnerable as well, and can alleviate a lot of stress from most trap rooms.
	+ If used again, it releases the enemy early.
* While playing as  [(Tainted Jacob)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") [Tainted Jacob](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob"):
	+ Anima Sola will always target Dark Esau if he is present.
	+ While Dark Esau is chained down, using Anima Sola again will release him and cause him to charge directly at Tainted Jacob, damaging and burning enemies in its path. This will not use up additional item charges.
	+ Dark Esau deals no contact damage to Jacob while chained down.
	+ If used in a room with no enemies, Anima Sola will immediately summon Dark Esau.


Notes[]
-------


* Enemies other than Dark Esau can also be released. This will not cause them to do anything special.
* If [The Visage](/wiki/The_Visage "The Visage")'s mask is chained down when it runs out of HP, it will outright die instead of becoming temporarily inactive, leaving only the heart to be fought. It is unknown if this is a bug.
* If [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart")/[It Lives](/wiki/It_Lives "It Lives") is chained down before it can spawn the [Eyes](/wiki/Eye "Eye") at the beginning of the fight and is damaged enough to advance a phase by the time the chains break, the Eyes will not spawn.
* [Delirium](/wiki/Delirium "Delirium") will stop shapeshifting when chained.
* If an enemy is in the middle of attacking with tears, their tears will still be fired after the effect ends. This happens even if the enemy has zero HP by the end of the ability.
* If used against [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") during her chase attack, the destructible pillars will stop spawning until the effect ends.

* [(9 Volt)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt"): Halves the recharge time, allowing for chaining enemies much more frequently.
* [(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a dark wisp that orbits the locked enemy and shoots at them. When the enemy dies, the wisp despawns.
* [(Car Battery)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Two enemies will be chained simultaneously. If only one valid enemy is present, it will be chained for twice the duration
