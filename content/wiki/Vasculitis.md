 # Vasculitis ![image](/image/Vasculitis.png) 

Effects
---------


* Upon killing an enemy, 1 - 16 tears are released from them in random directions.
	+ The amount of tears released from an enemy is based on the enemy's health, and is not affected by Isaac's damage, nor the number of tears hit.
	+ These tears are red in coloration, regardless of Isaac's tears, but will inherit the coloration of applied [status effects](/wiki/Status_Effects "Status Effects").
* Burst tears will do set damage per floor. The formula for this is: (3.2 + 0.3 x stage).


Notes
-------


* If an enemy is killed while affected by a [status effect](/wiki/Status_effect "Status effect"), the burst tears will inflict the corresponding effect.
* [Homing](/wiki/Tear_Effects "Tear Effects"), [range](/wiki/Range "Range") and [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_Speed "Shot Speed") do not affect Vasculitis.
* Released tears can be difficult to distinguish from enemy shots, especially from enemies which split in to burst shots upon death such as [Red Boom Flies](/wiki/Boom_Fly "Boom Fly") and light blue [champions](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters").
* All forms of damage will cause an enemy to release tears.
