 # IBS ![image](/image/IBS.png) 

Effects
---------


After dealing enough damage to an enemy, Isaac begins to flash red. Releasing the fire button gives the effect of one of  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???")'s unique poops.



### Throwable


Holds up one of the following types of poop, which he can throw with the fire buttons. All thrown poops deal 15 damage to enemies they hit when thrown (up to 3 times in the case of stone poop).

| (TaintedBlueBaby Poop.png)
 | Poop
 | A normal [Poop](/wiki/Poops "Poops"), the same as those found in any run.
 |
| (TaintedBlueBaby CornyPoop.png)
 | Corn Poop
 | Spawns a [blue fly](/wiki/Familiar#Blue_Flies "Familiar") every two seconds. Each corn poop can have up to 3 blue flies out at a time.
When the player exits the room, up to 3 flies will automatically follow the player to the next room. However, if the corn poops are destroyed before exiting, all the freed blue flies will follow the player.
 |
| (TaintedBlueBaby BurningPoop.png)
 | Flaming Poop
 | Leaves behind a fire that damages enemies and blocks enemy shots. The fire lasts 5 seconds and can block five shots and/or deal three ticks of contact damage before disappearing (the first hit will deal 16.5 damage, the second and third will deal 11).
 |
| (TaintedBlueBaby GreenPoop.png)
 | Stinky Poop
 | Emits a toxic cloud that deals 3.5 damage per tick to nearby enemies (10.5 damage per second). If an explosion or fire hits the cloud, it also explodes, dealing 15 damage to anything caught in the blast. When the poop is destroyed, it spawns a larger green toxic cloud that can't explode and goes away after 5 seconds.
 |
| (TaintedBlueBaby BlackPoop.png)
 | Black Poop
 | Continuously creates [slowing](/wiki/Status_Effects#Slow "Status Effects") [black](/wiki/Creep#Black_Creep "Creep") [creep](/wiki/Creep "Creep") and, when destroyed, deals 10 damage to and [confuses](/wiki/Status_Effects#Confusion "Status Effects") all enemies in the room. The poop will continue to create slowing creep even after it's destroyed.
 |
| (TaintedBlueBaby HolyPoop.png)
 | White Poop
 | Acts the same as a poop created by [![image](/image/Hallowed_Ground.png)](/wiki/Hallowed_Ground "Hallowed Ground") [Hallowed Ground](/wiki/Hallowed_Ground "Hallowed Ground"). Tainted ??? also gains the poop's effects while holding it.
 |
| (TaintedBlueBaby GreyPoop.png)
 | Stone Poop
 | Very resistant to damage and deals extra damage when thrown. It can hit multiple enemies when thrown, unlike all other poop types. It can stand several enemy hits, serving as a wall against bullets.
 |
| (TaintedBlueBaby Bomb.png)
 | Bomb
 | Explodes after 1.5 seconds even if Tainted ??? doesn't throw it. This bomb looks like a [Butt Bomb](/wiki/Butt_Bombs "Butt Bombs"), but will not have its unique effect. It will, however, use most of Tainted ???'s bomb synergies except for [![image](/image/Mr._Mega.png)](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") [Mr. Mega](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega"), [![image](/image/Rocket_in_a_Jar.png)](/wiki/Rocket_in_a_Jar "Rocket in a Jar") [Rocket in a Jar](/wiki/Rocket_in_a_Jar "Rocket in a Jar"), [(Ring Cap)](/wiki/Ring_Cap "Ring Cap") [Ring Cap](/wiki/Ring_Cap "Ring Cap"), and [(Short Fuse)](/wiki/Short_Fuse "Short Fuse") [Short Fuse](/wiki/Short_Fuse "Short Fuse").

### Non-Throwable

| --- | --- | --- |
| (TaintedBlueBaby Fart.png)
 | Fart
 | Deals 5 damage and [poisons](/wiki/Status_Effects#Poison "Status Effects") nearby enemies while pushing them and their bullets back and spawning a toxic cloud. If an explosion or fire hits the cloud, it also explodes, dealing 15 damage to anything caught in the blast. Reflected bullets can damage enemies, similarly to [![image](/image/Butter_Bean.png)](/wiki/Butter_Bean "Butter Bean") [Butter Bean](/wiki/Butter_Bean "Butter Bean").
 |
| (TaintedBlueBaby Diarrhea.png)
 | Explosive Diarrhea
 | Drop 5 live bombs over time, similarly to the [Explosive Diarrhea pill](/wiki/Pills "Pills"). These bombs will use Tainted ???'s bomb synergies.
 |
| (TaintedBlueBaby BrownCreep.png)
 | Brown Creep
 | Create a trail of brown [creep](/wiki/Creep "Creep") that deals 1.5x Tainted ???'s damage to enemies per tick (15x Tainted ???'s damage per second). Standing on this creep gives Tainted ??? +1 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage"), +1.5 [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears") fired per second, and other effects, depending on what's in contact with it. This creep persists indefinitely. When in contact with:
(TaintedBlueBaby BlackPoop.png) Black Poop: the creep also slows enemies and gives Tainted ??? slowing tears.
(TaintedBlueBaby GreenPoop.png) Toxic cloud from Stinky poop: the creep poisons enemies and gives Tainted ??? poison tears.
(TaintedBlueBaby BurningPoop.png) Flaming Poop: the creep burns enemies and gives Tainted ??? [![image](/image/Fire_Mind.png)](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind") [Fire Mind](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind").
(TaintedBlueBaby HolyPoop.png) White Poop & its Aura: the creep grants [homing](/wiki/Tear_Effects#Homing "Tear Effects") and triples Tainted ???'s fire rate and damage.
(TaintedBlueBaby GreyPoop.png) Stone Poop: the creep will keep all the extra effects of other poops, even if they are destroyed.

Notes
-------


* The chance for IBS to activate is dependent on the damage Isaac deals to enemies; the more damage an attack deals, the more likely it is to activate IBS.
* If IBS triggers while Isaac is charging a shot (with items such as [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"), [![image](/image/Monstro%27s_Lung.png)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"), [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"), etc.), the charged shot will only fire after IBS's effect activates. In the case of thrown poops, the charged shot only fires after Isaac throws the poop IBS gives him.
* Poops spawned by IBS can give [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups").
* If Isaac is currently holding a poop, IBS cannot activate until he throws it.
* Isaac can carry poop he is holding between rooms.
* If Isaac takes damage while holding a poop/bomb, he will drop it where he is standing.
* If Isaac hits an enemy with a thrown poop, it will immediately break.
