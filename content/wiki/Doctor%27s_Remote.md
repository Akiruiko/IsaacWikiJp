 # Doctor's Remote ![image](/image/Doctor%27s_Remote.png) 

Effect
--------


* Upon activation, a large red crosshair will appear on the ground. The player can control where the target is using the arrow keys.
* After approximately 2 seconds, a large missile will land on the red marker. The missile acts like a large bomb explosion dealing 20 times the character's damage (the same as [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus")).
