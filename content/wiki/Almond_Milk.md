Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Anti-Gravity)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): The tears will slowly move towards Isaac instead of remaining stationary. Releasing the fire button will launch the tears as usual.
* [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Overrides My Reflection.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Makes the beam curve when moving. It has the same effect on Azazel's mini-brimstone and doubles the range.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The laser makes a thin loop in front of Isaac, and fires the normal laser backwards.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Continuum)](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum") [Continuum](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum"): If tears cross the border of the room, they will move towards Isaac from their new position rather than crossing back across the border.

* [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): The tear will slowly move towards Isaac, and the shot speed increase allows the tear to be moved much faster.
* [(Mom's Knife)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): No effect, as the knife already has this effect.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Montezuma's Revenge)](/wiki/Montezuma%27s_Revenge "Montezuma's Revenge") [Montezuma's Revenge](/wiki/Montezuma%27s_Revenge "Montezuma's Revenge"): Causes the beam range behind Isaac to become significantly increased as well as having a short range similar to Azazel's beam in front of him.

	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Makes the beam curve when moving.
* [(Technology 2)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") / [(Tech.5)](/wiki/Tech.5 "Tech.5") [Tech.5](/wiki/Tech.5 "Tech.5")
