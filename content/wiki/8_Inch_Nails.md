Effect[]
--------


* Spawns a [charger](/wiki/Charger "Charger") [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that charges across the [room](/wiki/Room "Room") when Isaac shoots, dealing [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") to any enemies in its path until it hits an [obstacle](/wiki/Obstacle "Obstacle") or wall.
	+ (Removed in Afterbirth) Little Chubby is fired directly from where Isaac is standing.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Little Chubby is fired directly from where it is located in the chain of familiars behind Isaac.
	+ The familiar deals 3.5 damage per tick (~52.5 damage per second).
	+ The familiar's attack is affected by momentum, just as tears are. Thus, it can be shot diagonally.


Notes[]
-------


* For Little Chubby to recharge, it must first get back to Isaac. Therefore, running away from Little Chubby after firing it will extend the time required to recharge it.
* The enemy [Chubber](/wiki/Vis#Chubber "Vis") can attack like this item, but they have limited range.
