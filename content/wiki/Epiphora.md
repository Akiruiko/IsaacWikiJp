Effect[]
--------


* [Monsters](/wiki/Monster "Monster"), [pickups](/wiki/Pickup "Pickup"), and [trinkets](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket") are magnetically attracted to the player character's tears.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) This also applies to Isaac's bombs.
		- (Added in Repentance) Items will be attracted to where the magnetic tear lands.
	+ The effect may not affect certain immobile enemies; [Round Worms](/wiki/Round_Worm "Round Worm") will start to vibrate in the presence of multiple magnetic tears, but will not change their position, [Hosts](/wiki/Host "Host") will only be attracted when readying to launch an attack.


Notes[]
-------


* Extra caution must be taken when using this item, as the attraction effect will pull small, lightweight monsters like [Boom Flies](/wiki/Boom_Fly "Boom Fly") towards the character very fast and in an unpredictable manner, with the consequent risk of taking damage.
* (Added in Repentance) This item has been reworked and doesn't function like usual anymore. Now tears will attract only when the tear lands on the ground/sticks to an enemy.

* [(Mom's Knife)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Enemies are pulled towards the knife. The effect is minor while not firing and much stronger while the knife is launched.

* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Tractor Beam)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): The lack of random spread and momentum-based trajectories on tears makes the way enemies are pulled around more predictable.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Cricket's Body)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body")/(Added in Afterbirth †)[(Compound Fracture)](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") [Compound Fracture](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture"): Since tears will split into more tears, all traveling different directions, enemies will be randomly moved around.
* [(Epic Fetus)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Overrides Strange Attractor.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Enemies get drawn towards the target mark on the ground, ensuring that the missile will hit.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Explosivo)](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo") [Explosivo](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo"): Enemies will be pulled toward the stuck on tears, dragging them helplessly or grouping them for the explosion.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Haemolacria)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): Enemies and pickups are attracted to the main tear, but not burst tears.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Lachryphagy)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Enemies will often get sucked into tears, making it more difficult to feed tears or let them burst.
* [(Monstro's Lung)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"): Due to the high concentration of tears, enemies will be pulled towards Isaac at great force; in certain cases, enough force will be generated to pull enemies through rocks. This can greatly increase accuracy but depending on enemies' movements and positions can also damage Isaac.
* [(The Parasite)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Enemies will be pulled towards both fired tears and split tears. However, because they both travel in opposite directions, the split tears' magnetic effects tend to cancel each other out.
* [(Rubber Cement)](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement") [Rubber Cement](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement"): Due to tears being reflected, enemies tend to be pulled towards Isaac with much force. Additionally, the random angle of tears being reflected results in erratic enemy movement. **Not recommended.**
* [(Soy Milk)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): The rapid tears will pull enemies quickly and erratically around the room. **Not recommended.**
* [(Tiny Planet)](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") [Tiny Planet](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet")/(Added in Repentance)[(Immaculate Heart)](/wiki/Immaculate_Heart "Immaculate Heart") [Immaculate Heart](/wiki/Immaculate_Heart "Immaculate Heart"): The orbiting tears will cause enemies to be pulled towards Isaac. **Not recommended.**
