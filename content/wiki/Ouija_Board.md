Effect
--------


* Grants [spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears") that travel through obstacles (but not enemies) instead of breaking on impact with them.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/The_Parasite.png)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): When tears pass through solid objects, like rocks, they will split, resulting in many tears shooting out from every rock the original tear passed through.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Aesthetic only, no effect.
	+ [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel"): Only cosmetic effect.
* [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Bombs will become transparent and pass through objects, just like [spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears") do.
* [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): No effect.
* [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): Useless on both characters, as the bone club can hit through obstacles and  [![image](/image/The_Soul.png)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)") has spectral tears passively.
* (Added in Afterbirth)  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"): Useless, as The Lost starts with spectral tears by default.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): The knife becomes transparent but otherwise, Ouija Board has no effect.
* [(Tainted Lilith)](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith") [Tainted Lilith](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith"): Hardly useful, as most damage is done through Gello whips.
