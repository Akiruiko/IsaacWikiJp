Effects

* Causes all rocks to spawn 0-2 blue spiders when destroyed.
* This item belongs to the [Spider Baby](/wiki/Spider_Baby_(Transformation) "Spider Baby (Transformation)") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a humanoid spider.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/D12.png)](/wiki/D12 "D12") [D12](/wiki/D12 "D12"): Due to the high tendency of replacing rocks with [(TNT)](/wiki/TNT "TNT") [TNT](/wiki/TNT "TNT"), it allows for easy destruction of nearby rocks, resulting in lots of blue spiders.
