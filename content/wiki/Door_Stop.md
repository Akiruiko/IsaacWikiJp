 # Door Stop ![image](/image/Door_Stop.png) 

Effects
---------


* While held, the last door Isaac went through stays open, allowing him to leave the room even if enemies are in it.
	+ Does not prevent doors from closing due to other triggers, e.g. a (Challenge Room) [Challenge Room](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room") door will still close upon opening a chest.


Notes
-------


* Does not work on (Secret Room) [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") openings.
* Does not work in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode").
	+ (Added in Repentance) Cannot spawn in Greed Mode.
* This allows Isaac to leave rooms, including boss rooms, if the fight goes poorly.
	+ This becomes particularly useful in [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void"), where there are multiple boss rooms; Door stop lets the player peek behind each boss room, and thus able to decide whether to face [(Delirium)](/wiki/Delirium "Delirium") [Delirium](/wiki/Delirium "Delirium") or other bosses first.
* Leaving immediately after enemies have spawned gives the player information on the fight, potentially improving decision making.
* If a (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") has a [(Krampus)](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") fight in it, Isaac may choose not to fight him and leave.
* If an Angel fight is started in an (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") the door will close and prevent leaving despite the Door Stop.
* If [(Greed)](/wiki/Greed "Greed") [Greed](/wiki/Greed "Greed") spawns in a Secret Room or (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop"), Door Stop can be used to leave and come back to fight Greed again to potentially get more than one [(Steam Sale)](/wiki/Steam_Sale "Steam Sale") [Steam Sale](/wiki/Steam_Sale "Steam Sale").
* Does not affect [(Mom)](/wiki/Mom "Mom") [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom")'s boss room.
* Can be used to reset [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") shield. Very useful playing as  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost").
* (Removed in Repentance) If a room contained champion enemies, upon leaving and re-entering the room, all previous champion enemies will have turned to regular enemies.
* Cannot be used to escape (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") after the fight has started.
* Cannot be used to escape the [(Mega Satan)](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") fight.
