 # Red Candle ![image](/image/Red_Candle.png) 


Effects
---------


* Gives Isaac a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that fires chaotic bursts of tears in all directions at random intervals while in a room with enemies, shooting faster the closer it is to an enemy, similarly to [Boils](/wiki/Boil "Boil").
	+ Each tear fired by Boiled Baby does either 3.5 or 5.3 damage, with no in-between.
* This item belongs to the [Conjoined](/wiki/Conjoined "Conjoined") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a three-faced version of himself.
