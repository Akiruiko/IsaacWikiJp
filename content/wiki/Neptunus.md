Effects[]
---------


* When Isaac's normal tears disappear (either from hitting the ground or hitting something else), they spawn 4 smaller tears.
	+ Each smaller tear deals half of Isaac's normal [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
* Tear size multiplier: 1.2x.
	+ Split tears are scaled down by 0.6x from the main ones, ignoring damage based size reduction.
* (Removed in Repentance) -10 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
* (Added in Repentance) -20% [range](/wiki/Range "Range") multiplier.


* -1 [tear delay](/wiki/Tear_delay "Tear delay") (increased rate of fire)
	+ Since this directly affects tear delay instead of changing the tears stat, it allows Isaac's rate of fire to go over the normal maximum rate.
	+ Tear delay decreases are more noticeable and are a greater increase to DPS when the tears stat is high.


  




Notes[]
-------


* Any [status effect](/wiki/Status_effect "Status effect")-carrying tears: split tears will carry the same status effect.
* If Isaac has less than (Removed in Repentance)10 range, the split tears appear but cannot cause damage before hitting the floor.
	+ [(Cain)](/wiki/Cain "Cain") [Cain](/wiki/Cain "Cain"),  [(Lazarus)](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus") [Lazarus](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus"), and  [(Samson)](/wiki/Samson "Samson") [Samson](/wiki/Samson "Samson") have lower starting range and are particularly susceptible.
	+ [Tear height](/wiki/Tear_height "Tear height") creates no effect on this downside.
