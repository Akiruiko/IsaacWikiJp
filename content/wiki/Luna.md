 # Luna ![image](/image/Luna.png) 

Effects
---------


* Adds an extra (Secret Room) [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") and (Super Secret Room) [Super Secret Room](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room") to each floor, if possible.
* Reveals one random Secret Room on the map on pickup and at the start of each floor.
* Each newly discovered Secret Room has a shining beam of light that will raise [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears") for the current floor and gives Isaac a [(Half Soul Heart)](/wiki/Half_Soul_Heart "Half Soul Heart") [Half Soul Heart](/wiki/Half_Soul_Heart "Half Soul Heart") when walked under.
	+ The first light gives Isaac +1 tears fired per second, and all subsequent ones give +0.5 tears fired per second.
	+ This gives a potential +2.5 tears per second for a given floor, on top of 2 soul hearts.
	+ The tears up breaks the default 5 tears per second cap.
* Once the effect is triggered for the floor, a silver-bluish shine will appear around Isaac. This light will be strengthened for every beam of light "gathered".
	+ While this effect is mostly cosmetic, it also partially counteracts both the [Curse of Darkness](/wiki/Curses "Curses") and the "dark rooms" in the [(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines")/[(Ashpit)](/wiki/Ashpit "Ashpit") [Ashpit](/wiki/Ashpit "Ashpit").


Notes
-------


* The beams of light appear in both Secret Room types but not in (Ultra Secret Room) [Ultra Secret Rooms](/wiki/Ultra_Secret_Room "Ultra Secret Room").
	+ This includes Secret Rooms and Super Secret Rooms that appear as a result of [![image](/image/Red_Key.png)](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key") [Red Key](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key").
* The beams of light appear even in unopened Secret Rooms on the same floor the item was acquired on.
* The effect can also be obtained in the [Mirrored World](/wiki/Mirrored_World "Mirrored World").
* The tears up bonuses still apply while in the special area of [(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines")/[(Ashpit)](/wiki/Ashpit "Ashpit") [Ashpit](/wiki/Ashpit "Ashpit") II.
* No new Secret Rooms are added in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode") or [Chapter 1](/wiki/Chapters#Chapter_1 "Chapters") (if it's a starting item for  [(Eden)](/wiki/Eden "Eden") [Eden](/wiki/Eden "Eden")), but the beam of light is still added to current Secret Rooms.
* No new Secret Rooms are added in [(Home)](/wiki/Home "Home") [Home](/wiki/Home "Home").
* If kept after using [![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") with  [(Tainted Eden)](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden") [Tainted Eden](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden"), upon taking damage, the additional tear rate is lost. More beams of light will have to be found or used for the tears to be regained (assuming not all of them were used).
* The level generation does not guarantee an additional Super Secret Room can be placed; there is limited space for special rooms, and other types may take priority over it.
	+ Normal Secret Rooms are exempt from this limitation, and the extra one should always be available.
* Luna may make (Planetarium) [Planetariums](/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium") harder to encounter, as the extra Super Secret Room has priority over Planetariums in level generation.
* If playing [Co-op](/wiki/Co-op "Co-op") or as  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"), characters that did not pick up Luna will still gain full benefit from stepping within the beam of light. However, this will only benefit one character.
* Multiple copies of Luna will not cause additional Secret Rooms or Super Secret Rooms to be generated.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Fragmented Card)](/wiki/Fragmented_Card "Fragmented Card") [Fragmented Card](/wiki/Fragmented_Card "Fragmented Card"): The effects stack, spawning three Secret Rooms on the floor. All three Secret Rooms will contain beams of light.
