Effects[]
---------


* Adds a chance to shoot [fear tears](/wiki/Status_Effects#Effects "Status Effects"), causing enemies to run away from the player.


* -1 [tear delay](/wiki/Tear_delay "Tear delay") (increased rate of fire)
	+ Since this directly affects tear delay instead of changing the tears stat, it allows Isaac's rate of fire to go over the normal maximum rate.
	+ Tear delay decreases are more noticeable and are a greater increase to DPS when the tears stat is high.


* (Added in Repentance)Tears fired per second +0.5.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Yes Mother?](/wiki/Yes_Mother%3F "Yes Mother?") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into his mother.


Notes[]
-------


* The fear effect chance depends on the [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck") stat, starting at 12.5% at 0 luck, reaching 100% with 85 luck.
	+ [(Dark Matter)](/wiki/Dark_Matter "Dark Matter") [Dark Matter](/wiki/Dark_Matter "Dark Matter") is significantly better at inflicting fear than Mom's Perfume.
