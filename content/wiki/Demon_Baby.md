 # Demon Baby ![image](/image/Demon_Baby.png) 


Effects
---------


* Petrifies and turns enemies into gold upon contact with Isaac.
	+ Enemies killed while in this state will drop 1-4 [Pennies](/wiki/Penny "Penny").
* Enemies that make contact with Isaac take damage equal to the number of [coins](/wiki/Coin "Coin") he has.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The damage is 3.5+0.2x the number of Isaac's coins. The damage caps at 23.30 with 99 coins.
	+ Damage is dealt up to twice per second per enemy.


Notes
-------


* With Midas' Touch, some effects that create Poop may instead create [Golden Poop](/wiki/Golden_Poop "Golden Poop") (see Synergies for details).
* If an enemy doesn't deal contact damage, Midas' Touch can safely be used on it to create extra Pennies. [Black flies](/wiki/Black_Fly "Black Fly"), [Bulbs](/wiki/Bulb "Bulb"), [Mulligans](/wiki/Mulligan "Mulligan"), and [Hosts](/wiki/Host "Host") are the most common enemies this can be applied to.
	+ If Isaac has 13 coins or more when using Midas' Touch on Mulligans, they will die and release flies, hurting Isaac.
	+ With [![image](/image/Skatole.png)](/wiki/Skatole "Skatole") [Skatole](/wiki/Skatole "Skatole"), [Hives](/wiki/Hive "Hive") and [Swarmers](/wiki/Swarmer "Swarmer") will constantly spawn black flies, meaning they can create endless amounts of coins.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) As [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom")'s foot and [Satan](/wiki/Satan "Satan")'s feet don't deal contact damage, Midas' Touch can be used against them to great effect.
* (Added in Afterbirth) When used against [Ultra Greed](/wiki/Ultra_Greed "Ultra Greed"), his [armor](/wiki/Damage_scaling "Damage scaling") will be partially impaired to a 25% efficiency.
* Spawning Multiplayer [Babies](/wiki/Babies "Babies") while the player has Midas' Touch will give the Midas' Touch effects (freeze on touch + damage) to the baby itself. This can be abused, considering the baby's invincibility frames upon spawning:
	+ Spawn the baby using the Enter key. It is invincible for a short period.
	+ During this period, stay in contact with enemies to freeze them and damage them.
* This can be used to gather 99 [coins](/wiki/Coin "Coin") very quickly, and in turn, deal massive damage with Midas' Touch damage component.
* (Added in Repentance) Petrified enemies that are [frozen](/wiki/Freeze "Freeze") will not drop any coins on death.
* (Added in Repentance) Midas' Touch can be a great item with  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"), as you can run into enemies and get even more coins. Just be careful to not kill yourself.
* (Added in Repentance) Both Midas' Touch and [![image](/image/E._Coli.png)](/wiki/E._Coli "E. Coli") [E. Coli](/wiki/E._Coli "E. Coli") affect  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten")'s body, causing enemies that touch the body to freeze and turn into poop respectively.
