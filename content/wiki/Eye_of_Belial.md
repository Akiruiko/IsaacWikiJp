 # Eye of Belial ![image](/image/Eye_of_Belial.png) 


Effects
---------


* +1.5 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
* +1.0 [tear height](/wiki/Tear_height "Tear height").
* Grants [piercing tears](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears").
* After piercing one enemy, tears will gain double [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage"), [homing](/wiki/Homing_tears "Homing tears"), and a 1.3x size multiplier.


Notes
-------


* The piercing effect makes placed Bombs, Troll Bombs, and Megatroll Bombs unable to be pushed around by Isaac's tears.
* Tears will also gain homing and double damage when they pierce bombs and entities the game considers enemies, like [Grimaces](/wiki/Grimace "Grimace") and [fireplaces](/wiki/Fireplace "Fireplace").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Compound_Fracture.png)](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") [Compound Fracture](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture")/[![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body")/[![image](/image/The_Parasite.png)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Tears that pass through enemies will become Belial tears and split into smaller Belial tears. Non-Belial split tears can also turn into Belial tears if they pass through enemies.
* [![image](/image/Godhead.png)](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead") [Godhead](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead"): Normal tears and Eye of Belial tears will retain damaging aura.
* [![image](/image/Lachryphagy.png)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Eye of Belial tears can still be fed and will burst, and burst Eye of Belial tears will still be homing. Tears from regular bursts can also turn into Eye of Belial tears
* [![image](/image/Lost_Contact.png)](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact") [Lost Contact](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact"): Piercing through a projectile triggers the double damage and homing effect.
* [![image](/image/Remote_Detonator.png)](/wiki/Remote_Detonator "Remote Detonator") [Remote Detonator](/wiki/Remote_Detonator "Remote Detonator"): Placed Bombs won't explode automatically, so they can be placed and have tears fired through them to activate double damage and homing.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Tiny_Planet.png)](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") [Tiny Planet](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet"): After piercing an enemy, tears will continue orbiting rather than homing, but each tear can gain multiple damage and size multipliers. These tears can make quick work of even most bosses.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Saturnus.png)](/wiki/Saturnus "Saturnus") [Saturnus](/wiki/Saturnus "Saturnus"): When an orbiting tear hits an enemy, it will turn into an eye of belial tear. From that point, the tear gets out of (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Saturnus.png)](/wiki/Saturnus "Saturnus") [Saturnus](/wiki/Saturnus "Saturnus")' orbit every time an enemy is nearby, becomes autonomous and chases every enemy in the room. It won't be destroyed by enemies anymore. When there's no enemy close from it, it comes back into the orbit. As all 7 tears can become eye of belial ones, this synergy is significantly powerful.
* [![image](/image/Technology_Zero.png)](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero") [Technology Zero](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero"): All tears will be connected with electricity. Electricity will double in damage when the tears change.
