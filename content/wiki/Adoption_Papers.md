 # Adoption Papers ![image](/image/Adoption_Papers.png) 

Effects
---------


* (Shop) [Shops](/wiki/Shop "Shop") and (Black Market) [Black Markets](/wiki/Black_Market "Black Market") now sell [familiars](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") instead of the usual item selection.
	+ The familiars are chosen from the [Baby Shop item pool](/wiki/Baby_Shop_(Item_Pool) "Baby Shop (Item Pool)").
	+ While holding the Adoption Papers, the familiars are discounted to 10 coins. If the papers are dropped, they cost 15 coins.


Notes
-------


* A shop that has already been entered will not have its item selection changed, nor will dropping the papers revert them to normal.
* In [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode"), only the shop pool item is replaced with a familiar and discounted.
	+ This also applies to all shop pool items when playing as  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"). Familiars spawned from the Treasure Room pool remain unaffected.


Synergies
-----------


* [(Steam Sale)](/wiki/Steam_Sale "Steam Sale") [Steam Sale](/wiki/Steam_Sale "Steam Sale"): Both of the discounts stack, selling familiars for 5 cents.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Chaos)](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos") [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos"): Chaos takes priority in item selection. However, items will still be discounted.
* [(Keeper's Box)](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Box "Keeper's Box") [Keeper's Box](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Box "Keeper's Box"): Does not affect Keeper's Box' items, meaning both familiars and shop items can be purchased in tandem over the course of a run.
* [(The Stairway)](/wiki/The_Stairway "The Stairway") [The Stairway](/wiki/The_Stairway "The Stairway"): No effect on the Angel shop.
