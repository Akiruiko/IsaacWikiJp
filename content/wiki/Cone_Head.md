 # Cone Head ![image](/image/Cone_Head.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants +1 [Soul Heart](/wiki/Health#Soul_Hearts "Health").
* Any damage dealt to Isaac has a 20% chance to be ignored.
	+ This includes damage through tears, contact, explosions, [cursed doors](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room"), [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine"), and [Demon Beggars](/wiki/Beggar#Demon_Beggar "Beggar").
		- Contact damage with enemies is difficult to avoid, as the damage negation does not provide invincibility frames.
	+ Isaac flashes briefly blue when damage is negated. The flash can occur even while invincible from taking a hit or using an invincibility effect.
