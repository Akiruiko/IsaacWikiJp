 # Cone Head ![image](/image/Cone_Head.png) 


Effects
---------


* This item starts with no charges. Rather than gaining charges by clearing [rooms](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms") or picking up [batteries](/wiki/Batteries "Batteries"), Alabaster Box has to be charged by picking up [(Soul Heart)](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") or [(Black Heart)](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart") [Black Hearts](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart") – they would normally go towards [Isaac's health bar](/wiki/Health "Health"), but instead go towards charging the box at a rate of one charge per half heart. It requires 12 charges – 6 full Soul or Black Hearts – to be fully charged.
	+ If the box requires two or more charges and Isaac picks up a Black Heart, then the box gains charge as for a Soul Heart and the last Soul Heart (or half Soul Heart, if there is one) in Isaac's health will become black.
	+ If the box requires only one more charge and Isaac picks up a full Soul Heart or a Black Heart, then the box will become fully charged and one half heart of the same type will be added to Isaac's health.
	+ Soul health from [(Blended Heart)](/wiki/Blended_Heart "Blended Heart") [Blended Hearts](/wiki/Blended_Heart "Blended Heart") will also be used to charge the box. (They will, as usual, be used for red health first.)
* Upon activation, this item is consumed and will vanish from Isaac's inventory, spawning three [(Soul Heart)](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") and two [items](/wiki/Items "Items") from the [Angel Room item pool](/wiki/Angel_Room_(Item_Pool) "Angel Room (Item Pool)").
	+ If a [Devil Deal](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") was taken previously, it will spawn two Soul Hearts and one Angel Room item instead.
	+ There is a chance for each one of the spawned Soul Hearts to be replaced with an [(Eternal Heart)](/wiki/Eternal_Heart "Eternal Heart") [Eternal Heart](/wiki/Eternal_Heart "Eternal Heart").


Notes
-------


* If Isaac takes a Soul Heart [Devil Deal](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") while holding a charged Alabaster Box, it will take hearts from the box before it takes from Isaac's health.
	+ This also applies to The Lost, even though Devil Deals are supposed to be free for this character.
* If sleeping in a [bed](/wiki/Bed "Bed") would restore Soul Hearts, they will be used to charge the Alabaster Box instead. Any excess will be added as Soul Hearts as normal.
	+ This applies to The Lost, who is always in the state to recover Soul Hearts, even if usually without effect.
* [(Bulb)](/wiki/Sucker#Bulb "Bulb") [Bulbs](/wiki/Sucker#Bulb "Sucker") are capable of draining charges from Alabaster Box, so careful movement around them is advised.
* Batteries cannot be picked up while using this item, unless Isaac has [![image](/image/Schoolbag.png)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") and another active item that uses charges.


Synergies
-----------


* [(? Card)](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") [? Card](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card"): Activates the Box without consuming it, allowing for potential multiple uses.
* [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") /  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany"): Soul/blood charges count towards the charges for Alabaster Box.
* [![image](/image/The_Book_of_Belial.png)](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") [The Book of Belial](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") + [![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") as  [(Judas)](/wiki/Judas "Judas") [Judas](/wiki/Judas "Judas") /  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas"): Changes the payout to 2 [Black Hearts](/wiki/Hearts#Black_Heart "Hearts") and 1 item from the [Devil Room item pool](/wiki/Devil_Room_(Item_Pool) "Devil Room (Item Pool)"). If a [Devil Deal](/wiki/Devil_Deal "Devil Deal") has been taken, the payout is boosted to 3 Black Hearts and 2 Devil items.
* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns up to 8 normal wisps, filling up the middle ring.
* [(Found Soul)](/wiki/Found_Soul "Found Soul") [Found Soul](/wiki/Found_Soul "Found Soul"): As long as the Soul is alive, the Soul will also activate Alabaster Box if Isaac does it, basically doubling the rewards.
* [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Paw.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") [Guppy's Paw](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") + [![image](/image/Schoolbag.png)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"): Heart containers converted to Soul Hearts contribute to the Box's charge instead of being added to Isaac's health. This enables a full charge for just two heart containers.
* [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): Allows Isaac to charge the item normally, but its effects wear off after 1 use.
