 # Haemolacria ![image](/image/Haemolacria.png) 

Effects
---------


* Tears are fired in an arc. Upon hitting the floor, an obstacle, or an enemy they burst into many smaller tears in all directions.
* Tears down - `(Delay * 2) + 10`
* Increases damage by about 31%.
	+ The scattered tears deal random damage that is around 50-80% of the main tear.
	+ (Added in Repentance) +1 damage up and 1.5x damage multiplier.


Notes
-------


* Higher [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed") lowers the arc of the main shot, whereas lower speed heightens it, resulting in a very minor change in effective range.
	+ The split tears are affected normally by shot speed.
* The [tear height](/wiki/Tear_height "Tear height") stat is entirely ignored for both the main shot and the split tears.
* The main tear has a roughly 1.71x size multiplier.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Significantly increased tear delay. Isaac fires a large arcing tear that fires several Brimstone beams in random directions upon bursting.
	+ This does not apply to  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel")/ [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel")'s default brimstone beam.
	+ [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") + [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Chocolate Milk allows for rapid firing of Haemolacria tears, giving Isaac the ability to flood the room with Brimstone lasers, allowing for instant-kill potential
* [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): Increased tear delay. Completely charged shots and their burst tears are larger and deal higher damage than normal. Chocolate Milk also allows low-damage Haemolacria shots to be fired rapidly.
* [![image](/image/Compound_Fracture.png)](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") [Compound Fracture](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture")/[![image](/image/The_Parasite.png)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Similar to [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body"), tears will split, scattering massive amounts of smaller tears across the room. Hits on walls or the floor absorb most of the extra tears.
* [![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body"): A single tear can scatter massive amounts of smaller tears in a wide area regardless of what it hits.
* [![image](/image/Dead_Eye.png)](/wiki/Dead_Eye "Dead Eye") [Dead Eye](/wiki/Dead_Eye "Dead Eye"): Both the main tear and the burst tears can increase the damage bonus, but missing the burst tears won't reset it.
* [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Significantly increased tear delay. Isaac fires a large arcing tear reminiscent of a bomb that scatters into 3-5 bombs that explode simultaneously.
* [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): Several blood tears are scattered upon the bone club hitting an enemy. It also increases the size of the club, similar to [![image](/image/Polyphemus.png)](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") [Polyphemus](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus"). The throw is unaffected and does not scatter blood tears.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Godhead.png)](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead") [Godhead](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead"): The main tear has the damaging aura as well as the burst tears.
* [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Tear delay is increased by 1/3 compared to either of the items on their own, but Isaac now fires Ipecac shots that releases poisonous, high-damage but non-explosive split tears on impact.
* [![image](/image/Lachryphagy.png)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Tears look like Haemolacria. They can be fed and will burst into 8 tears that have Haemolacria's burst effect upon hitting obstacles or enemies.
* [![image](/image/Lead_Pencil.png)](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil") [Lead Pencil](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil") / [![image](/image/Monstro%27s_Lung.png)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"): Fires a barrage of Haemolacria tears, all of which will burst.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Haemolacria tears fire while Mom's Knife is charging.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Mom's Knife overrides Haemolacria tears, but all stat effects from Haemolacria apply.
	+ **Mom's Knife** +  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith"): Mom's Knife overrides Haemolacria.
* [![image](/image/My_Reflection.png)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection"): Range becomes extremely high, making Haemolacria tears follow Isaac for a long time before hitting the ground. Burst tears do not have a boomerang effect.
* [![image](/image/Mysterious_Liquid.png)](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid") [Mysterious Liquid](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid"): Only the main tear spawns creep.
	+ (Added in Repentance) All tears spawn creep.

* [![image](/image/Technology_Zero.png)](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero") [Technology Zero](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero"): Main tears and bursts can be connected via electricity.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Terra.png)](/wiki/Terra "Terra") [Terra](/wiki/Terra "Terra"): Haemolacria tears have increased knockback and can destroy obstacles.
* [![image](/image/Trisagion.png)](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion") [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion"): Both Trisagion and Haemolacria fire at the same time, Haemolacria does not keep spectral tears despite its tears sprite change but the arced tear keeps piercing.

	+ The burst tears themselves create more sad bombs, which leads to an indefinite cascade of explosions. **Not recommended** unless Isaac has [![image](/image/Pyromaniac.png)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") or [![image](/image/Host_Hat.png)](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") [Host Hat](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat"), as the bombs can damage Isaac.
