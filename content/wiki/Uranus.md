 # Uranus ![image](/image/Uranus.png) 

Effects
---------


* Isaac's tears become icicles that [freeze](/wiki/Freeze "Freeze") enemies upon death, turning them into ice statues.
	+ [Bosses](/wiki/Bosses "Bosses") and [mini-bosses](/wiki/Mini-boss "Mini-boss") cannot be frozen.
* Frozen enemies can be kicked, sliding and leaving damaging creep across the room and shattering when they hit a wall, [obstacle](/wiki/Obstacle "Obstacle") or an enemy, releasing 10 icicle tears in a circle.
	+ These icicles can either [slow](/wiki/Slow "Slow") enemies for 4 seconds or turn them into ice statues as well if they deal the lethal hit.
* Killing an enemy by freezing them will prevent any on-death effects to occur, such as split into other enemies, fire any post-death tears, explode, etc., even after shattering.


Notes
-------


* Isaac's own tears cannot apply a slowing effect on enemies. This property is only available for the icicle burst after shattering a frozen enemy.
* The on-shatter icicles deal damage equal to `8 + (floor - 1)` which is not affected by Isaac's stats.
	+ These tears do not inherit any of Isaac's tear effects.
* The blue creep left behind ice statues while they're sliding across the room rapidly deals 2 flat damage for 11 ticks per second, resulting in 22 damage per second.
	+ This is the same creep that's used by [![image](/image/Holy_Water.png)](/wiki/Holy_Water "Holy Water") [Holy Water](/wiki/Holy_Water "Holy Water").
* Ice statues have 10 health points and can be shattered if shot by 10 tears or projectiles.
	+ Isaac's damage is irrelevant here and each tear shot will deal only 1 point of damage to them.
	+ Enemies ignore the ice statues when targeting Isaac and they can also destroy them if shot enough times.
	+ Explosions will shatter the statues immediately.
* Enemies hit by a sliding ice statue receive 35 flat damage which is not affected by Isaac's stats or the current floor.
* Enemies killed by hit of a sliding ice statue or the blue creep will not be frozen.
* Frozen enemies are considered dead by the game, meaning they don't need to be shattered in order for the room to be cleared. If not shattered, they don't disappear until leaving the room.
* Champion enemies that drop consumables won't drop anything until their ice statue is shattered.
	+ As  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"), enemies will drop a [coin](/wiki/Coin "Coin") immediately when frozen.
