 # Ring Worm ![image](/image/Ring_Worm.png) 

Effects
---------


* Isaac's tears travel in a high-speed spiral pattern.
* (Added in Repentance) Grants [spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears").


Notes
-------


* The tear pattern slightly increases Isaac's effective range.
* (Removed in Repentance) The trinket has no effect on any non-tear based attack, such as [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") or [(Mom's Knife)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife").
	+ (Added in Repentance) The trinket now affects all tear/non-tear modifiers, with the only exceptions being [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"), [(Epic Fetus)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") and (Added in Afterbirth)[(Tech X)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"), which don't work.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[(Backstabber)](/wiki/Backstabber "Backstabber") [Backstabber](/wiki/Backstabber "Backstabber"): Due to the unusual tear travel, Ring Worm may be used to hit enemies in the back, without having the need to be placed behind them.
