 # Berserk! ![image](/image/Berserk!.png) 

Effects
---------


* When used, gives Isaac +0.4 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") and +3 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") and increases [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears") for 5 seconds, during which time he is restricted to using a jaw bone to damage enemies instead of his tears for 5 seconds, similarly to  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten")'s bone club.
	+ The jaw bone deals 3x Isaac's damage when swung and 1.5x Isaac's damage per tick when thrown (3x Isaac's damage per second).
	+ The swung jaw bone reflects enemy shots.
	+ The thrown jaw bone charges very quickly compared to the Forgotten's bone club, but as berserk only lasts five seconds, it uses a noticeable amount of the effect's limited duration to charge and throw the jaw bone.
	+ While Berserking, Isaac's tear delay is multiplied by 2, then his tears fired per second is increased by 2. This will be a tears upgrade unless Isaac already has a lot of tears upgrades.
		- If playing as The Forgotten, the x2 tear delay modifier isn't applied, as he already has it.
	+ Killing an enemy while "Berserking" increases Berserk's current duration by 1 second.
	+ Killing an enemy also grants very brief invincibility, preventing damage from exploding enemies.
	+ Isaac is unable to die while Berserk is active. He can be reduced to 0 hearts, but will not die until the effect ends.
* This item charges when Isaac deals damage to enemies rather than by clearing rooms or picking up batteries. It requires a base total of 120 damage, and increases by 40 for every next floor.


Notes
-------


* The jaw bone has all the same synergies that The Forgotten's bone club does.
	+ [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): While the synergy between Mom's Knife and the Berserk state is identical to The Forgotten's melee attack, it is worth noting that the attack no longer deflects enemy shots.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a pale wisp on the middle ring. The wisp has extra HP and does not shoot.
* [![image](/image/Suplex!.png)](/wiki/Suplex! "Suplex!") [Suplex!](/wiki/Suplex! "Suplex!"): Suplex when used in berserk state has a unique visual effect, and will deal massive damage to the target and set off a [![image](/image/Mama_Mega!.png)](/wiki/Mama_Mega! "Mama Mega!") [Mama Mega!](/wiki/Mama_Mega! "Mama Mega!") style of explosion, destroying all [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacle "Obstacle") in the current room and dealing 200 damage to every enemy (including [Bosses](/wiki/Boss "Boss")).
* [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") /  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost"): This can allow either variant of The Lost to survive being damaged if it happens while Berserk is active. Despite having no visible health bar, their health is normally set to half a soul heart. If they take damage while Berserk is active, they will not die if they are able to pick up a soul heart or half soul heart before the effect ends.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/4.5_Volt.png)](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") [4.5 Volt](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") / [![image](/image/9_Volt.png)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") / [![image](/image/Jumper_Cables.png)](/wiki/Jumper_Cables "Jumper Cables") [Jumper Cables](/wiki/Jumper_Cables "Jumper Cables"): No effect.
* [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Duration is only extended if no enemies are killed during the first half, thus only providing a benefit against bosses that can't spawn enemies.
* [![image](/image/Sharp_Plug.png)](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug") [Sharp Plug](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug"): Isaac will take damage without gaining any charges.
