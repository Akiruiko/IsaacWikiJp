 # Virgo ![image](/image/Virgo.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants a chance to trigger the [![image](/image/Book_of_Shadows.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Shadows "Book of Shadows") [Book of Shadows](/wiki/Book_of_Shadows "Book of Shadows") effect upon taking damage, creating a [shield](/wiki/Shield "Shield") that nullifies all types of damage for 10 seconds.
	+ The activation chance depends on the [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck") stat and goes up to 100% with 10 Luck.
* Converts all negative [pills](/wiki/Pill "Pill") into positive ones, but does not identify them.


Notes
-------


* The shield negates health loss from [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine") and [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_Beggar "Devil Beggar").
* Does not prevent [Red Heart container](/wiki/Red_Heart_container "Red Heart container") loss from [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") deals.
* Bad pills already obtained/dropped will be converted to their "good" counterpart.
* As bad pills will turn into good pills, it is possible for two different colored pills to have the same effect.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Celtic_Cross.png)](/wiki/Celtic_Cross "Celtic Cross") [Celtic Cross](/wiki/Celtic_Cross "Celtic Cross"), [![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid"): Can trigger as the same time as Celtic Cross or The Polaroid, cumulating to up to 22 seconds of shield.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/False_PHD.png)](/wiki/False_PHD "False PHD") [False PHD](/wiki/False_PHD "False PHD"): Pills can be both good and bad again. Taking bad pills still applies the benefits from False PHD.
