 # Mom's Purse ![image](/image/Mom%27s_Purse.png) 

Effects
---------


* Allows two different [trinkets](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket") to be carried at once.
* (Added in Repentance) Spawns one random trinket. Two copies of the same trinket can be held.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Yes Mother?](/wiki/Yes_Mother%3F "Yes Mother?") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into his mother.


Synergies
-----------


* [(Tick)](/wiki/Tick "Tick") [Tick](/wiki/Tick "Tick"): Lets you gain the benefits of the item without losing your only trinket slot.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) You cannot replace the [(Tick)](/wiki/Tick "Tick") [Tick](/wiki/Tick "Tick") with The [(Match Stick)](/wiki/Match_Stick "Match Stick") [Match Stick](/wiki/Match_Stick "Match Stick") once it is picked up, as it will only occupy the second trinket slot.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[![image](/image/Belly_Button.png)](/wiki/Belly_Button "Belly Button") [Belly Button](/wiki/Belly_Button "Belly Button"): No effect; Isaac can still only hold two trinkets.
