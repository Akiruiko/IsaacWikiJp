	+ (Added in Repentance) The poison lasts for 6-7 ticks and deals damage equal to (0.2*HeartContainers^2) + 2, where HeartContainers is the total number of [heart containers](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health") and [bone hearts](/wiki/Health#Bone_Hearts "Health") Isaac has.
		- The poison can be continuously applied to bosses, which normally are immune to status effects for a brief time after being inflicted with one.
* (Added in Repentance) Lets Isaac deal 24 contact damage per tick on top of applying poison (48 damage per second).
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) Enemies who are killed after they have been inflicted with this type of poison have a 20% chance to drop [Black Hearts](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart").
* (Removed in Repentance) -0.1 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") down.
	+ (Removed in Afterbirth) This is not applied until the next time Isaac's speed stat is updated.
* (Added in Repentance) +0.2 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") up.

Notes[]
-------


* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) The black heart is only dropped if the poison was caused by The Virus. The item's effect doesn't extend to poison tears.
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) If an enemy doesn't do contact damage, The Virus can safely be applied to it for more chances at black hearts. [Black flies](/wiki/Black_Fly "Black Fly"), [Mulligans](/wiki/Mulligan "Mulligan"), and [Hosts](/wiki/Host "Host") are the most common enemies this can be applied to.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) With [(Skatole)](/wiki/Skatole "Skatole") [Skatole](/wiki/Skatole "Skatole"), [Hives](/wiki/Hive "Hive") and [Swarmers](/wiki/Swarmer "Swarmer") will constantly spawn normal Flies, meaning they can be endless sources of Black Hearts.
	+ (Removed in Afterbirth †) Although [Stonies](/wiki/Stoney "Stoney") and [Shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper") can't be visibly poisoned, they still can drop Black Hearts if destroyed after being touched.
* Enemies won't start taking poison damage if they are pushing up against Isaac; The Virus will be constantly trying to apply poison and refreshing the ticks where poison damage would occur.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) [(Gnawed Leaf)](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf") [Gnawed Leaf](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf") and The Virus can still work if Isaac has a short-range orbital such as [(Cube of Meat)](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") [Cube of Meat](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") or [(Ball of Bandages)](/wiki/Ball_of_Bandages "Ball of Bandages") [Ball of Bandages](/wiki/Ball_of_Bandages "Ball of Bandages"), as it will kill enemies pushing against Isaac that are not taking poison damage while still dropping Black Hearts.
