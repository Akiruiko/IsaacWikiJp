Effect
--------


* Grants a charged shot that fires 14 tears in the same fashion as [Monstro](/wiki/Monstro "Monstro").
	+ The attack can be released only when fully charged.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Tears down: Delay * 4.3.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Fire rate is divided by 4.3 (roughly 0.23x).
	+ Each tear has a random size multiplier between 0.9x to 1.33x, but there is no effect on damage.

* [![image](/image/20/20.png)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") / [![image](/image/The_Inner_Eye.png)](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") [The Inner Eye](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") / [![image](/image/Mutant_Spider.png)](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") [Mutant Spider](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider"): Adds 2, 5 or 7 tears to the barrage respectively. For the latter two, greatly slows down the charge.
	+ **20/20** + **The Inner Eye**: 10 extra tears.
	+ **20/20** + **Mutant Spider**: 14 extra tears.
	+ **The Inner Eye** + **Mutant Spider**: 14 extra tears.
	+ **All three**: 19 extra tears.
* [![image](/image/Anti-Gravity.png)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): overidden, but tear delay down still applies, which greatly reduced the charge time, leading to better damage output.
* [![image](/image/Blood_Clot.png)](/wiki/Blood_Clot "Blood Clot") [Blood Clot](/wiki/Blood_Clot "Blood Clot"): All tears are larger, with increased damage (as opposed to every 2nd tear like Blood Clot alone)
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) Tears have a 50% chance to be Blood Clot tears.
* (Added in Afterbirth) [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Fires 3-5 additional Brimstone lasers in random directions around Isaac. It does not increase the charge time. This effect also applies to  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") and (Added in Repentance) [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel")'s versions of Brimstone.
	+ + (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Eye_Sore.png)](/wiki/Eye_Sore "Eye Sore") [Eye Sore](/wiki/Eye_Sore "Eye Sore") Not recommended. Overrides this synergy with a chance to shoot 1-3 additional Brimstone lasers in random directions.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): Continuously fires shotgun-style tears without the need to release the attack button, resulting in a significant damage per second increase.
* [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): Reduces Isaac's tear delay by 20%, and each tear from Monstro's Lung is a charged Chocolate Milk shot, massively increasing fire rate and damage.
	+ This does not apply to  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith")'s Incubus; picking up Chocolate Milk will significantly reduce damage and increase charge time.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Tear delay is increased, and the tear damage, along with the amount of tears fired is dependent on charge time.
* (Added in Afterbirth) [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Isaac spits multiple bombs but must charge to fire. Bombs detonate simultaneously.

* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Flat_Stone.png)](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone") [Flat Stone](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone"): All tears bounce simultaneously; the effective range is greatly increased.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Isaac spews multiple Ipecac tears, with no increase in charge time.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Isaac spews multiple Ipecac tears. Charge time is greatly increased.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"): Grants a charged shot, but rather than firing a cluster of tears, fires a cluster of zigzagging lasers in a short-range spread pattern.
	+ +[![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): Continuously fires laser clusters without having to charge.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Tech_X.png)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): Fires a group of laser rings with size dependent on how long they were charged, with increased charge time.
* (Added in Afterbirth) [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Tear becomes a cluster of variably sized tears spread over a small area. The tears move at the same speed when controlled but constantly move around each other.
* (Added in Afterbirth) [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Fires an additional cluster of 3-5 knives when at maximum charge, each dealing 2x tear damage.

	+ (Added in Repentance) Amount of spiders spawned dependent on luck.
* **Monstro's Lung**: Additional copies of the Lung add 10 tears to the barrage.
* [![image](/image/My_Reflection.png)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection"): Tears stay in the air much longer and consistently, allowing better reach and more focused blasts before the tears returning to Isaac.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Tractor_Beam.png)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): All the tears follow the beam at different heights without spreading out, making it much easier for multiple tears to hit a target.
