 # Lead Pencil ![image](/image/Lead_Pencil.png) 


Effects
---------


* Spawns a random [Harbinger](/wiki/The_Harbingers "The Harbingers") [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that changes every 10 seconds. All harbingers deal contact damage to enemies and periodically spawn [locusts](/wiki/Locust "Locust") if Isaac currently doesn't have any, though each harbinger behaves slightly differently:
	+ [(Famine)](/wiki/Famine "Famine") [Famine](/wiki/Famine "Famine") wanders around the room, leaves a trail of slowing black creep, deals 0.5 contact damage per tick or 15 damage per second, and spawns [yellow locusts](/wiki/Locust_of_Famine "Locust of Famine") every 3 seconds that deal double Isaac's damage and slows enemies.
	+ [(Pestilence)](/wiki/Pestilence "Pestilence") [Pestilence](/wiki/Pestilence "Pestilence") wanders around the room, leaves a trail of green creep that deals 1 damage per tick or 30 damage per second, deals 0.5 contact damage per tick or 15 damage per second, and spawns [green locusts](/wiki/Locust_of_Pestilence "Locust of Pestilence") every 3 seconds that deal double Isaac's damage and poisons enemies, which deals double Isaac's damage over time.
	+ [(War)](/wiki/War "War") [War](/wiki/War "War") chases enemies, moves faster than the other Harbingers, deals 1.5 contact damage per tick or 45 damage per second, and spawns [red locusts](/wiki/Locust_of_War "Locust of War") every 5 seconds which detonates upon impact with enemies, dealing double tear damage for the impact of the locust and 60 damage for the explosion. The explosion synergizes with multiple bomb related items.
	+ [(Death)](/wiki/Death_(Boss)#Death "Death") [Death](/wiki/Death_(Boss)#Death "Death (Boss)") chases enemies, deals 1.5 contact damage per tick or 45 damage per second, and spawns [black locusts](/wiki/Locust_of_Death "Locust of Death") every 3 seconds that deal quadruple Isaac's damage, applied as two hits of double damage.
	+ [(Conquest)](/wiki/Conquest "Conquest") [Conquest](/wiki/Conquest "Conquest") wanders around the room, deals 0.5 contact damage per tick or 15 damage per second, and spawns two [white locusts](/wiki/Locust_of_Conquest "Locust of Conquest") at a time every 2 seconds that deal double Isaac's damage.
		- (Removed in Repentance) Conquest ignores the locust spawn timer.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance)If Conquest is on top of an enemy when Isaac has no white locusts, it will spawn locusts at an incredibly high rate and deal a lot of damage.
* If an enemy is large enough to stand on multiple segments of Pestilence's creep trail, the damage from each pool of creep will stack.
* The locusts that War spawns can damage Isaac if they explode near him.
	+ This makes it possible to gain multiple varying horsemen and gain all of their locusts at one time


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Increases Horsemens' size and doubles their contact damage. Does not affect locusts spawned.
* [![image](/image/Bomber_Boy.png)](/wiki/Bomber_Boy "Bomber Boy") [Bomber Boy](/wiki/Bomber_Boy "Bomber Boy"): War's locusts explode in a small horizontal cross-shape pattern.
* [![image](/image/Box_of_Friends.png)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends"): Creates another random horseman that can be different from the original.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Brimstone_Bombs.png)](/wiki/Brimstone_Bombs "Brimstone Bombs") [Brimstone Bombs](/wiki/Brimstone_Bombs "Brimstone Bombs"): War's locusts will shoot out four brimstone beams in a + formation after hitting an enemy.
* [![image](/image/Hive_Mind.png)](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind") [Hive Mind](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind"): Increases locusts' size and doubles their damage.
* [![image](/image/Sad_Bombs.png)](/wiki/Sad_Bombs "Sad Bombs") [Sad Bombs](/wiki/Sad_Bombs "Sad Bombs"): War's locusts fire a ring of ten tears outward upon detonation, which are affected by Isaac's tear modifiers, and deal damage equal to 15 + 0.6x, where x is Isaac's [Damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").


Interactions
--------------


* [(Fish Tail)](/wiki/Fish_Tail "Fish Tail") [Fish Tail](/wiki/Fish_Tail "Fish Tail"): Despite working with the locust trinkets, it does not double locusts from any of the 7 Seals Horsemen.
