Effects
---------


* Isaac gains a short delay charge attack that fires [homing](/wiki/Homing "Homing"), [piercing](/wiki/Piercing "Piercing"), [spectral](/wiki/Spectral "Spectral") fetus tears.
	+ The fetus tears do [Damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") equal to Isaac's, about 5 times per second, until they run out of [Range](/wiki/Range "Range").
	+ The fetuses will automatically fire when Isaac is at full charge, meaning the charge cannot be held. Ultimately, the charge functions more like a long tear delay than an actual charge.
	+ Charge time is 1 second per 10 [Tear Delay](/wiki/Tear_Delay "Tear Delay").
		- For this reason, Isaac cannot fire the fetuses when Tear Delay is below 0.


Notes
-------


* Fetus size scales with damage.
* The fetuses slow down upon contacting enemies, making its homing effect more powerful.
