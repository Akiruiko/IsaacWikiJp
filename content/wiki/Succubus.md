Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): No actual effect. Succubus and its damaging aura are only visually larger, but the damage is neither increased nor dealt any further away from the familiar.
* [![image](/image/Libra.png)](/wiki/Libra "Libra") [Libra](/wiki/Libra "Libra"): When Isaac is within the aura, affects re-balanced stats rather than just damage.
