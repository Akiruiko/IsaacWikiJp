 # Duality ![image](/image/Duality.png) 

Effects
---------


* Whenever a [Devil](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room")/[Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") spawns after defeating a boss, the other will also spawn.
	+ Upon entering one, the other one will disappear.
	+ Both rooms will spawn even if a devil deal was made before.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) In rooms with only two accessible walls, only one of the two will spawn.


Notes
-------


* Even with [![image](/image/Goat_Head.png)](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head") [Goat Head](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head") or [![image](/image/Eucharist.png)](/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist") [Eucharist](/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist") both rooms will not stay open, and entering either of the rooms will make the other disappear.
* If Duality was bought through a Devil deal, it is still possible to get [Angel Rooms](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") as well as [Devil Rooms](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room").
* Teleportation via a [(Joker)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Joker") [Joker](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") card, a Red Chest or a Sacrifice Room *before* defeating the boss and choosing a door will follow the normal rules of Devil/Angel Room generation, instead of a 50/50 chance.
	+ The room that was chosen this way will be the only one that opens once the boss is defeated.
	+ Teleporting after choosing a door will always take you to the same room.
