 # Razor Blade ![image](/image/Razor_Blade.png) 


Effects
---------


* Drops 1-6 random [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") around Isaac.
* Causes items to be chosen from random [item pools](/wiki/Item_pool "Item pool").
	+ Fixed item drops that ignore the current room's item pool will not be replaced. Examples include [![image](/image/Cube_of_Meat.png)](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") [Cube of Meat](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") after defeating one of [The Harbingers](/wiki/The_Harbingers "The Harbingers") as a floor boss, or [![image](/image/The_Small_Rock.png)](/wiki/The_Small_Rock "The Small Rock") [The Small Rock](/wiki/The_Small_Rock "The Small Rock") after breaking a [Tinted Rock](/wiki/Tinted_Rock "Tinted Rock").


Notes
-------


* When playing [Greed mode](/wiki/Greed_mode "Greed mode"), items that are available only in the normal game will still not appear despite Chaos; the modes' different item pools stay separate.
* As the item does not mix or combine item pools, it is possible to deplete smaller item pools and end up with [![image](/image/Breakfast.png)](/wiki/Breakfast "Breakfast") [Breakfast](/wiki/Breakfast "Breakfast") before all items in the game have been taken.
	+ Thus, if Chaos tries to pull from an item pool that is already depleted, it will not pull from a different pool and instead give Isaac Breakfast.
		- As many Greed Mode item pools are small, Chaos tends to result in Breakfast more often during Greed mode.
* (Removed in Repentance) Chaos will draw items even from item pools that are not used in the game, but defined in the game's files. The unused pools are `bossrush` containing nearly all bomb related items, `challenge` with a smaller selection of bomb items and `dungeon` containing several Mom related items and food items.
* (Removed in Repentance) Since all item pools have the same probability of being selected, bomb-related items are much more common due to the [Bomb Bum](/wiki/Bomb_Bum_(Item_Pool) "Bomb Bum (Item Pool)"), `bossrush` and `challenge` item pools.
* (Added in Repentance) Each pool has a weight based on the number of items in the pool. Items from large pools such as [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room_(Item_Pool) "Treasure Room (Item Pool)"), [Shop](/wiki/Shop_(Item_Pool) "Shop (Item Pool)"), and [Boss](/wiki/Boss_(Item_Pool) "Boss (Item Pool)") are very likely, while items from small pools like [Bomb Bum](/wiki/Bomb_Bum_(Item_Pool) "Bomb Bum (Item Pool)") and [Planetarium](/wiki/Planetarium_(Item_Pool) "Planetarium (Item Pool)") are more rare.
* If an item outside of the [Devil Room pool](/wiki/Devil_Room_(Item_Pool) "Devil Room (Item Pool)") appears as a [Devil Deal](/wiki/Devil_Deal "Devil Deal"), it will always cost 1 Red Heart Container (or 3 Soul Hearts should Isaac have no Red Hearts).
* (Added in Afterbirth †) Bosses defeated in [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") drop items as if Chaos was active. Re-rolling the items uses the Boss Room pool as normal.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Sacrificial_Altar.png)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar") [Sacrificial Altar](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar"): Ignores Chaos's effect and always picks items from the normal [Devil Room pool](/wiki/Devil_Room_(Item_Pool) "Devil Room (Item Pool)"), even on Greed Mode.
