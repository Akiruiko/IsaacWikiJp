 # Ocular Rift ![image](/image/Ocular_Rift.png) 

Effects
---------


* Gives Isaac a 5% chance to fire tears that create rifts where they land, which damage nearby enemies and pull in [enemies](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters"), [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups"), and tears/shots from all sources for 2 seconds.
	+ Rifts deal 0.5x Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") twice each tick (3x Isaac's damage per second), and enemy shots pulled into the rift will damage other enemies.
	+ The size of the rift increases with Isaac's damage.


Notes
-------


* The chance to fire a rift is vaguely affected by [Luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck"), but caps at a certain point, and is never guaranteed to trigger.
