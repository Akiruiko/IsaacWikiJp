Effect[]
--------


* Upon taking damage, spawns six [Troll Bombs](/wiki/Troll_Bomb "Troll Bomb") around the room, similar to the effect of [(XVI - The Tower)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XVI - The Tower") [XVI - The Tower](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes").


Notes[]
-------


* Despite appearing as Troll Bombs, the bombs are mechanically identical to player-placed bombs and will benefit from Isaac's bomb-enhancing items.
* These bombs hurt the player as well as enemies.
* Taking damage from the Troll Bombs spawned by Curse of the Tower or any other type of bomb, including Isaac's bombs, will not re-activate the effect.
* (Removed in Repentance) Picking up this item will make all health transactions more difficult. [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_Beggar "Devil Beggar") and [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine") will be almost impossible to use because they will very likely be destroyed by bombs.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Taking damage from [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_Beggar "Devil Beggar") and [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine") does not trigger the effect.
* The bombs prefer to spawn near the center of the room.
* The 6 [Troll Bombs](/wiki/Troll_Bomb "Troll Bomb") are difficult to dodge in small rooms.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Pyromaniac)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac"): Troll Bombs will heal Isaac instead, allowing for essentially infinite health with proper usage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Due to Pyromaniac being weakened to healing half a heart per explosion in *Repentance*, this synergy requires [(The Wafer)](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer") [The Wafer](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer") to continue being effective past [Chapter 3](/wiki/Chapter_3 "Chapter 3")/[Chapter 3.5](/wiki/Chapter_3.5 "Chapter 3.5").
* [(The Polaroid)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid"): If Isaac is damaged when he has half a red heart or no red hearts, the shield will activate and protect him from the Troll Bombs.
* [(Remote Detonator)](/wiki/Remote_Detonator "Remote Detonator") [Remote Detonator](/wiki/Remote_Detonator "Remote Detonator"): The Troll Bombs generated will not explode until Remote Detonator is activated, unlike regular Troll Bombs.
* [(Safety Scissors)](/wiki/Safety_Scissors "Safety Scissors") [Safety Scissors](/wiki/Safety_Scissors "Safety Scissors"): The Troll Bombs generated will be converted into bomb pickups rather than exploding.
