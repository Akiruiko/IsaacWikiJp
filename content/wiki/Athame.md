 # Athame ![image](/image/Athame.png) 

Effect
--------


* When Isaac takes damage, a black ring briefly appears around him, dealing tear damage at a rapid rate to everything touching it.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) When an enemy is killed with the black ring, there is a 15% chance for it to drop a [Black Heart](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart").
		- (Added in Repentance) Athame no longer has a chance to spawn black hearts upon killing enemies with the black ring.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Black Hearts will drop as soon as the enemy is killed. (In other words, the heart will drop at the beginning of the death animation rather than at the end of the death animation.)


Notes
-------


* The ring is similar in appearance to the combination of [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") and [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone").
* It is identical to the ring created by [![image](/image/Maw_of_the_Void.png)](/wiki/Maw_of_the_Void "Maw of the Void") [Maw of the Void](/wiki/Maw_of_the_Void "Maw of the Void").
* (Removed in Repentance) Especially effective against [Envy](/wiki/Envy "Envy") and [Super Envy](/wiki/Super_Envy "Super Envy"). Each piece of Envy grants a 15% chance for a Black Heart. It is also effective against [Brownie](/wiki/Brownie "Brownie") due to all the [Brownie Corns](/wiki/Brownie_Corn "Brownie Corn") it spawns.
