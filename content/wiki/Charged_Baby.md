Effects
---------


* Grants two [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart").
* Isaac gains a pulsing blue aura that repels enemies and projectiles.
	+ The power of the repel force alternates in strength at random, sometimes strong enough to counter a projectile well before it hits Isaac, sometimes only strong enough to slow it down.
	+ Ground-based enemies will overcome the counterforce easier than flying enemies and projectiles.
