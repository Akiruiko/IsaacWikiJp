Effects
---------


* Spawns a battery [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that:
	+ Occasionally spawns a [Lil' Battery](/wiki/Lil%27_Battery "Lil' Battery").
		- (Added in Repentance) Can also spawn a [Micro Battery](/wiki/Micro_Battery "Micro Battery") or [Mega Battery](/wiki/Batteries#Mega_Battery "Batteries") instead.
	+ Occasionally adds a charge to Isaac's [activated item](/wiki/Items#Activated_Collectibles "Items"). It does this a maximum of 2 times per [room](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms").
	+ Occasionally [petrifies](/wiki/Status_Effects#Petrification "Status Effects") all enemies.


Notes
-------


* Charged Baby becomes very powerful as  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") in [Greed mode](/wiki/Greed_mode "Greed mode"), as the duplicates will continue to spawn Lil' Batteries, leading to a huge chain of familiars.


Synergies
