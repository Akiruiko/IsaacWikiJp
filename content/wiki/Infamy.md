 # Infamy ![image](/image/Infamy.png) 


Effects
---------


* Adds a 50% chance to block projectiles hitting Isaac directly. When effectively blocking a projectile, Isaac will briefly flash blue.


Notes
-------


* Although the mask is seen only on Isaac's face, projectiles still have a 50% chance to be blocked from any direction.
* When combined with (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Host_Hat.png)](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") [Host Hat](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat"), Isaac gains a very high chance to block projectiles.
* Has no added effect when duplicated with (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Diplopia.png)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Holy_Mantle.png)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle"): Infamy's chance of blocking projectiles is applied before the Holy Mantle, allowing the Holy Mantle shield to be saved.
