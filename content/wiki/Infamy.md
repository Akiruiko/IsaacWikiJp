Effects
---------


* Enemy shots that hit Isaac have a 50% chance to be blocked
	+ After effectively blocking a projectile, Isaac will briefly flash blue. Isaac in this state can still take damage from another projectile.
	+ Can block:
		- Fireballs (e.g. from (Added in Repentance) [(Crackle)](/wiki/Gaper#Crackle "Crackle") [Crackle](/wiki/Gaper#Crackle "Gaper")), but their lines of fire harm Isaac.
		- Fire projectiles (e.g. from [(Mega Satan)](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan")).
		- Obstacles thrown by (Added in Repentance) [(Polty)](/wiki/Polty "Polty") [Polty](/wiki/Polty "Polty") or (Added in Repentance) [(Kineti)](/wiki/Polty#Kineti "Kineti") [Kineti](/wiki/Polty#Kineti "Polty").
	+ Does not block:
		- Explosive projectiles (e.g. from [(Gurgle)](/wiki/Gaper#Gurgle "Gurgle") [Gurgle](/wiki/Gaper#Gurgle "Gaper")).
		- Lasers or beams.
		- Lines of fire from fireballs.
		- Projectiles from (Added in Repentance) [(Big Bony)](/wiki/Fatty#Big_Bony "Big Bony") [Big Bony](/wiki/Fatty#Big_Bony "Fatty"), (Added in Repentance) [(Coal Boy)](/wiki/Danny#Coal_Boy "Coal Boy") [Coal Boy](/wiki/Danny#Coal_Boy "Danny"), (Added in Repentance) [(Danny)](/wiki/Danny "Danny") [Danny](/wiki/Danny "Danny").


Notes
-------


* Although the mask is seen only on Isaac's face, projectiles still have a 50% chance to be blocked from any direction.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Cone_Head.png)](/wiki/Cone_Head "Cone Head") [Cone Head](/wiki/Cone_Head "Cone Head"): Blocking effect from either item can occur.
	+ This leaves Isaac 60% chance to negate tears.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Holy Card)](/wiki/Holy_Card "Holy Card") [Holy Card](/wiki/Holy_Card "Holy Card") / [![image](/image/Holy_Mantle.png)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle"): Infamy's chance of blocking projectiles is applied before the shield, allowing the shield to be saved.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Host_Hat.png)](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") [Host Hat](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat"): Infamy's blocking effect is applied first. Host Hat does not fire tears when a tear is blocked by Infamy.
	+ This leaves Isaac 60% chance to negate tears.
* Infamy: Additional copy of this item from such as (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Diplopia.png)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") / (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Crooked_Penny.png)](/wiki/Crooked_Penny "Crooked Penny") [Crooked Penny](/wiki/Crooked_Penny "Crooked Penny") has no effect.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Metal_Plate.png)](/wiki/Metal_Plate "Metal Plate") [Metal Plate](/wiki/Metal_Plate "Metal Plate"): Infamy's blocking effect is applied first. Tears blocked by Infamy are not reflected by Metal Plate.
	+ This leaves Isaac 62.5% chance to negate tears in any way.
