 # Bobby-Bomb ![image](/image/Bobby-Bomb.png) 


Effects
---------


* -0.3 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed").
	+ (Removed in Repentance) -0.3 maximum speed.
* When in a room with enemies, Isaac gradually gains speed at a rate of +0.065 per tick.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) This speed boost will be able to go past the lowered maximum.
* Once Isaac's speed reaches 2.0, he gains the [![image](/image/My_Little_Unicorn.png)](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn") [My Little Unicorn](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn") effect for 5 seconds, becoming [invulnerable](/wiki/Invulnerability "Invulnerability"), and loses the speed bonus from Taurus afterward.


Notes
-------


* Isaac slowly gains a red tint that becomes more intense as he gains speed.
* The speed boost and invulnerability effect activate only once per room.
* The higher Isaac's base speed, the quicker the effect activates. It can activate immediately upon entering a room if his base speed is already 2.0 .
* The item doesn't trigger in rooms that don't have enemies when first entered. This includes [Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room"), [Sacrifice Rooms](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room") when spawning [Uriel](/wiki/Uriel "Uriel") or [Gabriel](/wiki/Gabriel "Gabriel"), and the [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") room.
* If Isaac gets teleported out of the room by any source, the [![image](/image/My_Little_Unicorn.png)](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn") [My Little Unicorn](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn") effect won't trigger if the room is re-entered.
* Bombs can be placed during the charge.
* (Added in Repentance) When playing as  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"), the speed changes apply for both, but only the character that is holding Taurus gains invincibility.


Synergies
-----------


* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Blood_Rights.png)](/wiki/Blood_Rights "Blood Rights") [Blood Rights](/wiki/Blood_Rights "Blood Rights"): While Isaac is invincible, Blood Rights can be freely used without taking damage. This trivializes many rooms, and since Taurus can activate every room, this combination can be game-changing, especially if Isaac has high base speed.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Isaac will still take damage from Blood Rights during the invincibility.
* [![image](/image/Gnawed_Leaf.png)](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf") [Gnawed Leaf](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf"): Isaac's speed will still increase while he is invincible from Gnawed Leaf, allowing Taurus to activate with only a very small period of vulnerability when first entering a room.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Rock_Bottom.png)](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom") [Rock Bottom](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom"): Isaac keeps the maximum speed boost after reaching it once.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Serpent%27s_Kiss.png)](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") [Serpent's Kiss](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss")/[![image](/image/The_Virus.png)](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus") [The Virus](/wiki/The_Virus "The Virus"): Isaac will poison enemies in addition to dealing damage to them on contact.


Interactions
--------------


* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Libra.png)](/wiki/Libra "Libra") [Libra](/wiki/Libra "Libra"): Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") and [range](/wiki/Range "Range") increases as speed increases. However, if Isaac's base speed is not high enough, the invincibility never activates.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Damage, Range, and Tear delay increase as speed increases. Speed increases much slower than normal.
* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Isaac cannot control the tear while invincible, but any enemies touching it will still take damage from it.
