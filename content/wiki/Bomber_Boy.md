Effects
---------


* Grants 5 [bombs](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb").
* Causes bombs to explode in a large cross-shaped blast by adding two additional explosions in each cardinal direction.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The damage for a single explosion is unchanged, but each successive explosion that hits the same enemy has its damage halved. The damage per successive explosion is: 60, 30, 15, 7.5, 3.75, 1.875, 0.9375, 0.46875, 0.234375
	+ (Added in Repentance) The damage for a single explosion is 0.75x times its normal damage, resulting in 75 damage per explosion. Each successive explosion that hits the same enemy has its damage halved. The damage per successive explosion is: 75, 37.5, 18.75, 9.375, 4.6875, 2.34375, 1.171875, 0.5859375, 0.29296875.
	+ [![image](/image/Mr._Mega.png)](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") [Mr. Mega](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") changes the explosions' base damage to (Removed in Repentance)110/(Added in Repentance)185, with the same damage reductions as above.


Notes
-------


* With Bomber Boy, [Bedrooms](/wiki/Bedroom "Bedroom"), [super special rocks](/wiki/Super_special_rock "Super special rock") and (Added in Repentance)the [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines") can be accessed with a single bomb.
* Bombing the [Donation Machine](/wiki/Donation_Machine "Donation Machine") will cause a greater than normal amount of coins to drop from the Donation Machine.
	+ The total amount of dropped coins is still deducted from the Donation Machine, however.
* (Removed in Afterbirth â€ ) Bombing a Blue or Purple [Fire Place](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place") may cause it to drop multiple Soul Hearts.
* (Added in Repentance) Bombs are colored blue and no longer have a skull on them.


Synergies

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Bob%27s_Brain.png)](/wiki/Bob%27s_Brain "Bob's Brain") [Bob's Brain](/wiki/Bob%27s_Brain "Bob's Brain"): Bomber Boy affects the explosion from Bob's Brain.
* [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Bomber Boy affects the bombs fired by Dr. Fetus.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Bomber Boy affects the missiles' explosions from Epic Fetus, with the explosions' multiplier resulting in 15 times Isaac's damage per explosion. Unlike with regular bombs, Bomber Boy won't decrease the damage from each of the missile's successive explosions, drastically increasing damage.
* [![image](/image/Mr._Mega.png)](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") [Mr. Mega](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega"): All explosions deal more damage, have a larger radius and will overlap each other more, potentially vastly increasing damage. Caution should be exercised, as the explosions' increased radius make self-damage likely.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Sad_Bombs.png)](/wiki/Sad_Bombs "Sad Bombs") [Sad Bombs](/wiki/Sad_Bombs "Sad Bombs"): Each explosion releases 10 tears in all directions.
