Effects[]
---------


* Spawns a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that chases nearby enemies and deals 2 contact damage to them per tick (4 per second).
* After killing 15 enemies, Blood Puppy becomes angry, and changes in the following ways:
	+ Deals 7.5 damage per tick instead of 2 (15 per second).
	+ Charges at enemies that are aligned with it in the cardinal directions.
		- If Blood Puppy charges into a live [bomb](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb"), it will get caught on its mouth, preventing it from moving until it explodes.
	+ Drops a [half red heart](/wiki/Hearts#Half_Red_Heart "Hearts") for every 10 enemies it kills.
	+ Will also try to attack Isaac, dealing a half heart of contact damage to him.
	+ Can be damaged by Isaac, returning it to normal after it takes enough damage. Blood Puppy has 20 health and 90 [Armor](/wiki/Damage_Scaling "Damage Scaling") (effective health is ~140-180).
* After getting 25 more kills (40 total), the angry version evolves, gaining the following modifications:
	+ Becomes much larger and deals 15 damage per tick instead of 7.5 (30 per second).
	+ Destroys [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles") it runs into while charging.
	+ Deals a full heart of damage to Isaac instead of half a heart.
	+ Drops a [full red heart](/wiki/Hearts#Red_Heart "Hearts") after every 10 kills instead of a half red heart.
	+ Has 50 health instead of 20 (effective health is ~400-500).


Notes[]
-------


* Blood Puppy appears in the [bestiary](/wiki/Bestiary "Bestiary") as a type of monster, if the player turns it back to normal after it becomes angry. This is required to complete the bestiary.
* Blood Puppy is not targeted by other familiars while it is angry.
	+ [Blue Flies](/wiki/Blue_Fly "Blue Fly") and other familiars that deal contact damage will still damage Blood Puppy if they happen to collide.
* Since [bombs](/wiki/Bombs "Bombs") ignore armor, a single bomb will tame the Blood Puppy.
* Stages 2 and 3 of Blood Puppy are an enemy for all intents and purposes, similar to [Dark Esau](/wiki/Dark_Esau "Dark Esau"). This means it can be affected by, for example, the slow effect of [(Broken Watch)](/wiki/Broken_Watch "Broken Watch") [Broken Watch](/wiki/Broken_Watch "Broken Watch").
* Friendly Blood Puppies will spawn beside Isaac when he enters a new room while hostile ones will spawn in the middle or opposite ends of the room.
* Starting the [Dogma](/wiki/Dogma "Dogma") or [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") fight while Blood Puppy is angry can be dangerous, as it will let Blood Puppy attack the player while the player is unable to move during the boss spawning animation.
