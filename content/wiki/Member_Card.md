* Spawns a trapdoor in each shop that leads to an additional underground shop that can sell 2-5 of the following:
	+ A [Trinket](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket") for 15 cents.
	+ An [Item](/wiki/Item "Item") for 15-30 cents. Items will be from the [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room_(Item_Pool) "Secret Room (Item Pool)"), [Shop](/wiki/Shop_(Item_Pool) "Shop (Item Pool)"), [Devil](/wiki/Devil_Room_(Item_Pool) "Devil Room (Item Pool)")/[Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room_(Item_Pool) "Angel Room (Item Pool)"), or  [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_(Item_Pool) "Boss (Item Pool)") items; there can be multiple items from different item pools, but items will stay to their chosen item pool if rerolled.
		- Devil/Angel room items can cost up to 50 cents, and Secret Room items can cost up to 99 cents.
	+ A [Card](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Cards "Cards and Runes")/[Rune](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Runes "Cards and Runes")/[Soul Stone](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Soul_Stones "Cards and Runes") for 6-8 cents.
	+ A [Black Heart](/wiki/Hearts#Black_Heart "Hearts")/[Bone Heart](/wiki/Hearts#Bone_Heart "Hearts") for 8 cents.
	+ An [Eternal Heart](/wiki/Hearts#Eternal_Heart "Hearts") for 15 cents.
	+ A [Rotten Heart](/wiki/Hearts#Rotten_Heart "Hearts") for 5 cents.


Notes[]
-------


* The trapdoor spawns even if the shop was replaced by [Greed](/wiki/Greed "Greed") or [Super Greed](/wiki/Super_Greed "Super Greed"), in which case it won't open until Greed has been defeated.
* Similar to [Crawl Spaces](/wiki/Crawl_Space "Crawl Space"), there is only one secret shop per floor. The trapdoors in extra shops created by [(Red Key)](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key") [Red Key](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key") will lead to the same secret shop.
* Should the Member Card be removed from the player's inventory (for example, by playing  [(Tainted Isaac)](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") and replacing it with a different item), the trapdoor will still remain open once it has been spawned, even after leaving and reentering the shop.
* The trapdoor will appear in the [Mirrored World](/wiki/Mirrored_World "Mirrored World") version of the shop. Despite the shop itself being empty, the trapdoor will lead to the same secret shop where the items are still for sale. Buying from the secret shop in the Mirrored World will thus remove the bought item from both worlds.
