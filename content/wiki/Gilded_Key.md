 # Gilded Key ![image](/image/Gilded_Key.png) 

Effects
---------


* Replaces all new chests with [(Locked Chest)](/wiki/Locked_Chest "Locked Chest") [Golden Chests](/wiki/Locked_Chest "Locked Chest").
* Modifies the contents of Golden Chests to be able to give [cards](/wiki/Card "Card") and [trinkets](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket") from a single chest alongside normal pickups.
	+ Also allows Golden Chests to drop [pills](/wiki/Pill "Pill").
* Gives Isaac one [(Key)](/wiki/Key "Key") [Key](/wiki/Key "Key") when picked up for the first time.


Notes
-------


* [(Old Chest)](/wiki/Old_Chest "Old Chest") [Old Chests](/wiki/Old_Chest "Old Chest") and [(Mega Chest)](/wiki/Mega_Chest "Mega Chest") [Mega Chests](/wiki/Mega_Chest "Mega Chest") cannot be overwritten by Golden Chests.
* The contents of Golden Chests can be changed retroactively by picking up/dropping Gilded Key. This can even be observed if Isaac has [(Guppy's Eye)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye") [Guppy's Eye](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye"), allowing him to see what the chest would have if he did(n't) have the key and choose which payout he wants.
	+ This also applies to chests that use Golden Chests' loot systems, such as [(Bomb Chest)](/wiki/Bomb_Chest "Bomb Chest") [Bomb Chests](/wiki/Bomb_Chest "Bomb Chest") and [(Eternal Chest)](/wiki/Eternal_Chest "Eternal Chest") [Eternal Chests](/wiki/Eternal_Chest "Eternal Chest").
	+ Mega Chests will also have their contents modified if they didn't contain items.
	+ The difference in contents between the two chest payouts are independent from each other; regardless of if the original chest had an item, card, trinket, or pickups, the modified chest can have any combination of them.
		- Modified chests are still unable to spawn pickups alongside items.
* Gilded Key does not retroactively change chests that have already spawned into Golden Chests, or change their contents.
* Golden Chests in will still spawn items.
* The unique [(Red Chest)](/wiki/Red_Chest "Red Chest") [Red Chests](/wiki/Red_Chest "Red Chest") in the beginning room of the [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") will be replaced.
