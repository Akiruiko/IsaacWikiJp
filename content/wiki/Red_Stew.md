 # Red Stew ![image](/image/Red_Stew.png) 


Effects
---------


* Isaac can store up to 4 extra [Red Hearts](/wiki/Hearts#Red_Heart "Hearts") in The Jar if there are no remaining empty [Heart Containers](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health").
* When used, all Red Hearts in the jar are dropped on the floor, rather than directly consuming them.


Notes
-------


* Red hearts are the only type of heart that can be stored. Blended Hearts do not count.
* If used in the two [Super Secret Rooms](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room") that contain nothing but a [Black Heart](/wiki/Hearts#Black_Heart "Hearts") or [Eternal Heart](/wiki/Hearts#Eternal_Heart "Hearts") (Room ID's 1 and 6), it will spawn those types of hearts instead.
* If a whole red heart is picked up and Isaac only heals half a heart container, the other half is placed in the jar, indicated by the jar number increasing by one. Despite the jar indicating that it picked up a whole red heart in this fashion, it will only drop half a red heart on use. When picking up a double red heart, the jar will also store the remainder not healed in the same way.
* [Co-op](/wiki/Co-op "Co-op") babies, except Magnet Baby, cannot add hearts to the jar, as they are unable to interact with pickups.
* The short-lived half red hearts dropped by  [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") can be picked up and stored.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Consumes stored hearts to spawn heart wisps, rather than releasing heart pickups. Heart Wisps have a chance to drop a [half red heart](/wiki/Hearts#Half_Red_Heart "Hearts") when destroyed.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Humbling_Bundle.png)](/wiki/Humbling_Bundle "Humbling Bundle") [Humbling Bundle](/wiki/Humbling_Bundle "Humbling Bundle") / [![image](/image/Maggy%27s_Bow.png)](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Bow "Maggy's Bow") [Maggy's Bow](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Bow "Maggy's Bow"): Spawn double the hearts put into the jar, allowing for infinite health to be spawned.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Broken Remote)](/wiki/Broken_Remote "Broken Remote") [Broken Remote](/wiki/Broken_Remote "Broken Remote"): Allows for teleportation with no recharge; however, it drops the contained red hearts in the room it was used.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): The Jar acts as usual, and doesn't double the hearts dropped upon activation.
* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[![image](/image/Schoolbag.png)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"): The player cannot pick up extra hearts while The Jar is in the inactive slot.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Shard_of_Glass.png)](/wiki/Shard_of_Glass "Shard of Glass") [Shard of Glass](/wiki/Shard_of_Glass "Shard of Glass"): Storing a heart in the jar does not stop the bleeding effect, despite playing the "heart collected" sound effect.
