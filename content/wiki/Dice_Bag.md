 # Dice Bag ![image](/image/Dice_Bag.png) 

Effects
---------


* Has a 50% chance to give Isaac a one-time use [Dice item](/wiki/Dice_(Disambiguation) "Dice (Disambiguation)") in a consumable slot when he enters a new room. The dice disappears when he leaves the room.
	+ This doesn't replace any consumables Isaac already has.


Notes
-------


* If Isaac leaves and re-enters a room, Dice Bag will not try to give another die when Isaac re-enters it.
* The dice given are determined by the amount of rooms cleared, and are not actually tied to specific rooms.
* Any die can be given to Isaac, including ones that haven't been unlocked yet.
* Dice Bag cannot give [(Spindown Dice)](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") [Spindown Dice](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice"), [(D Infinity)](/wiki/D_Infinity "D Infinity") [D Infinity](/wiki/D_Infinity "D Infinity"), [![image](/image/Cracked_Dice.png)](/wiki/Cracked_Dice "Cracked Dice") [Cracked Dice](/wiki/Cracked_Dice "Cracked Dice"), or [(Dice Shard)](/wiki/Dice_Shard "Dice Shard") [Dice Shard](/wiki/Dice_Shard "Dice Shard").
* Dropping the trinket on the ground does not remove the die until Isaac leaves the room.

Interactions

* [(Glowing Hour Glass)](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass") [Glowing Hour Glass](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass"): The die given in the room Isaac used Glowing Hour Glass in will be granted in the next new room Isaac visits, regardless of what it is.
