Effects[]
---------


* Fires a powerful [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") beam in the four cardinal directions, much like [The Fallen](/wiki/The_Fallen "The Fallen") and [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") shoot.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Afterbirth â€ ) Has a 50% chance to rotate all beams around the player 90 degrees, similar to Krampus' second Brimstone attack.


Notes[]
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Each beam deals 22 damage per tick, and they tick a total of 20 times, dealing a total of 440 damage per use.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Each beam deals 10 damage over 19 ticks, dealing a total of 190 damage per use.
* Damaging enemies with the effect of this item as [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy") will spawn multiple [Blue Flies](/wiki/Blue_Fly "Blue Fly").
* By standing really close to large enemies such as bosses, it's possible to hit them with multiple beams at once, dealing significantly more damage than a single beam.


Synergies[]
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns red wisps in the middle ring. The wisps fire small [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") lasers in the cardinal directions when destroyed. The lasers deal the wisps' tear damage per tick, and can hit up to 20 times. [(BFFS!)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") will not increase this damage, despite it scaling with the wisps' tear damage.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Car Battery)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Doubles the damage the brimstone beams deal (for a total of (Removed in Repentance) 880 damage/(Added in Repentance) 380 damage per use). Doesn't double the brimstone beams' duration.
