Effects
---------


* +5 [(Bomb)](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb") [Bombs](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb").

	+ (Removed in Repentance) Explosions heal one full Red Heart.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Explosions heal one half Red Heart.
* (Added in Repentance) Grants immunity to damage from [(Fire Place)](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place") [Fire Places](/wiki/Fire_Place "Fire Place") or enemy fires, but does not heal Isaac.
	+ It does not protect the player from taking damage from the [(White Fire Place)](/wiki/White_Fire_Place "White Fire Place") [White Fire Places](/wiki/White_Fire_Place "White Fire Place") in [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") II, making it still possible to acquire [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_1.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") [Knife Piece 1](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1").


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Pyromaniac is a [Special Item](/wiki/Special_Item "Special Item").
* (Removed in Repentance) Makes the player immune to [(Mom)](/wiki/Mom "Mom") [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom")'s, [(Satan)](/wiki/Satan "Satan") [Satan](/wiki/Satan "Satan")'s, and other enemies' stomp attacks, making those fights substantially less difficult.
	+ Due to the immunity to Mom's stomping attack, [(Mom's Toenail)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Toenail "Mom's Toenail") [Mom's Toenail](/wiki/Mom%27s_Toenail "Mom's Toenail") has improved usefulness.
* (Removed in Repentance) Makes the player immune to [(The Cage)](/wiki/The_Cage "The Cage") [The Cage](/wiki/The_Cage "The Cage")'s, [(The Adversary)](/wiki/The_Adversary "The Adversary") [The Adversary](/wiki/The_Adversary "The Adversary")'s, [(Mega Satan)](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan")'s, and (Added in Afterbirth †) [(Ultra Greedier)](/wiki/Ultra_Greed#Ultra_Greedier "Ultra Greedier") [Ultra Greedier](/wiki/Ultra_Greed#Ultra_Greedier "Ultra Greed")'s rock wave attack.
* The item is unable to produce [(Soul Heart)](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart"), [(Black Heart)](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart") [Black Hearts](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart"), or [(Eternal Heart)](/wiki/Eternal_Heart "Eternal Heart") [Eternal Hearts](/wiki/Eternal_Heart "Eternal Heart"), making Pyromaniac a little less effective if used with  [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)"),  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas"), (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas"),  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"),  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"), or  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany"). However, these characters still gain immunity to explosions, with  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") benefiting the most out of all.
* (Removed in Repentance) Makes the player immune to fires left behind by enemies and their hot bombs, as well as projectiles from [(Red Fire Place)](/wiki/Red_Fire_Place "Red Fire Place") [Red Fire Places](/wiki/Red_Fire_Place "Red Fire Place") and [(Purple Fire Place)](/wiki/Purple_Fire_Place "Purple Fire Place") [Purple Fire Places](/wiki/Purple_Fire_Place "Purple Fire Place"), but **not** the fireplaces themselves.
* (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) [(Ultra Greedier)](/wiki/Ultra_Greed#Ultra_Greedier "Ultra Greedier") [Ultra Greedier](/wiki/Ultra_Greed#Ultra_Greedier "Ultra Greed") uses explosive attacks almost exclusively. As a result, Pyromaniac makes characters nearly invulnerable against him.
* One of only two items that grant full immunity to explosive damage, the other being (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Host_Hat.png)](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") [Host Hat](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat").


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Curse_of_the_Tower.png)](/wiki/Curse_of_the_Tower "Curse of the Tower") [Curse of the Tower](/wiki/Curse_of_the_Tower "Curse of the Tower"): Whenever Isaac gets hit, numerous healing troll bombs fill the room, nullifying nearly any red heart damage taken.

* [![image](/image/Kamikaze!.png)](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!") [Kamikaze!](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!"): Provides an unlimited source of explosions which will heal.
