Effects[]
---------


* Spawns a hairball [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that loosely follows behind Isaac, blocks shots, and can be swung like a flail to damage enemies.
	+ The ball deals 5 damage per tick, but grows, increasing damage by 2 each time it kills an enemy — up to 5 times for a maximum of 13 damage. The damage it deals per tick (each half-second) is `(level × 2) + 3`.
	+ The hairball level decreases upon entering a new floor: if level 2, it reverts to level 1. If level 3 or 4, it reverts to level 2. If level 5, it reverts to level 3.
* This item belongs to the [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Guppy.


Notes[]
-------


* The hairball's hitbox is the same size regardless of level.
* (Removed in Afterbirth †) If Isaac has transformed into [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy"), Guppy's Hair Ball spawns Blue Flies when it deals damage.
* If [Blindfolded](/wiki/Blindfolded "Blindfolded"), the ball occasionally spawns a [Blue Fly](/wiki/Blue_Fly "Blue Fly") while it's damaging an enemy.
