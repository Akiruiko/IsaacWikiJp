 # Dark Bum ![image](/image/Dark_Bum.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that follows Isaac around and collects [Red Hearts](/wiki/Hearts#Red_Heart "Hearts"). (He does not fill up a familiar "slot".) For every one-and-a-half Red Hearts collected, Dark Bum will generate one of the following:
	+ (Removed in Repentance) A single [Soul Heart](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart").
	+ A hostile [Spider](/wiki/Spider "Spider").
	+ A friendly [Blue Spider](/wiki/Blue_Spider "Blue Spider").
	+ A single [Black Heart](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart").
	+ (Added in Repentance) A random [pill](/wiki/Pill "Pill"), [card, or rune](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes").




(Added in Repentance) Loot Table
| Pickup
 | Chance
 |
| --- | --- |
| [Black Heart](/wiki/Hearts#Black_Heart "Hearts") | 40%
 |
| [Card or Rune](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") | 20%
 |
| [Pill](/wiki/Pills "Pills") | 20%
 |
| [Blue Spider](/wiki/Familiar#Blue_Spiders "Familiar") | 10%
 |
| [Spider](/wiki/Spider "Spider") | 10%
 |


* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Super Bum](/wiki/Super_Bum "Super Bum") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac's bums into Super Bum.


Notes
-------


* If Dark Bum enters one of a set of (Super Secret Room) [Super Secret Rooms](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room") which allow only certain types of Hearts to generate in them, he will drop that type of heart instead of what he would normally instead.
	+ The one which only allows Red Hearts will cause Dark Bum to consume the Red Hearts on the floor only to generate yet more Red Hearts. Leading Dark Bum around the room to consume the Red Hearts and then leaving the room before he's able to generate anything will avoid this.
* Dark Bum will not pick up (Added in Afterbirth) [Gold Hearts](/wiki/Gold_Heart "Gold Heart"), (Added in Afterbirth †) [Blended Hearts](/wiki/Blended_Heart "Blended Heart"), (Added in Afterbirth †) [Bone Hearts](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart"), or (Added in Repentance) [Rotten Hearts](/wiki/Rotten_Heart "Rotten Heart").
* Very beneficial for characters that can't have heart containers ( [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)"),  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???"),  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas"),  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas"),  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten")) since they have no use for Red Hearts.
* [Scared Hearts](/wiki/Scared_Heart "Scared Heart") will run away from Dark Bum. Try to pinch them between Dark Bum and Isaac so he can collect them.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Little_C.H.A.D..png)](/wiki/Little_C.H.A.D. "Little C.H.A.D.") [Little C.H.A.D.](/wiki/Little_C.H.A.D. "Little C.H.A.D."): Each Half Red Heart dropped by Little C.H.A.D. can be collected by Dark Bum, increasing the amount of pickups dropped.
* [![image](/image/Gimpy.png)](/wiki/Gimpy "Gimpy") [Gimpy](/wiki/Gimpy "Gimpy"): Enemy kills have the chance to drop Half Red Hearts that can be collected by Dark Bum, which when combined with Gimpy's chance to drop Soul Hearts when Isaac is damaged is a good way to generate Black Hearts as well as other pickups.
* [![image](/image/Humbling_Bundle.png)](/wiki/Humbling_Bundle "Humbling Bundle") [Humbling Bundle](/wiki/Humbling_Bundle "Humbling Bundle"): Most Red Heart drops will become Double Red Heart drops. This counts as two full Red Hearts for Dark Bum, essentially doubling the value of it.
