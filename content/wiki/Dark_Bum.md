Effects[]
---------


* Shows the contents of [Chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests"), [Fire Places](/wiki/Fire_Places "Fire Places"), [Sacks](/wiki/Sacks "Sacks"), and [Shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper") before they're opened/destroyed.
* This item belongs to the [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Guppy.


Notes[]
-------


* Guppy's Eye does not show the contents of [tinted rocks](/wiki/Tinted_rock "Tinted rock"), [Poops](/wiki/Poops "Poops"), and other obstacles.
* Guppy's Eye does display enemies that can be contained within chests.
* [Chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest") and [Sacks](/wiki/Sack "Sack") can only display up to four pickups at a time. If there are more than four, higher-value pickups like [Bombs](/wiki/Bombs "Bombs"), [Keys](/wiki/Keys "Keys"), and [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Soul_Hearts "Soul Hearts") will have priority on the display.
* If a [Red Chest](/wiki/Red_Chest "Red Chest") looks like it doesn't have anything in it, it will teleport Isaac to the floor's (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") / (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room").
* Due to how [Trinkets](/wiki/Trinkets "Trinkets") generate, if a Chest displays a trinket, all future Chests will also display/give that trinket until it spawns in some way, at which point all Chests will display a new trinket.
* [Mimic Chests](/wiki/Mimic_Chest "Mimic Chest") will change their contents whenever their spikes pop out. The only way to get the original drops is to open it with [(Flat File)](/wiki/Flat_File "Flat File") [Flat File](/wiki/Flat_File "Flat File") or [(Magneto)](/wiki/Magneto "Magneto") [Magneto](/wiki/Magneto "Magneto").
* This effect works on all non-[ending](/wiki/Ending "Ending") chests, including [Mom's Chest](/wiki/Mom%27s_Chest "Mom's Chest").
* This item is substantially less useful in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode"), due to the scarcity of chests.
* The contents of Sacks or Chests that haven't spawned yet will still be revealed (for example, in rooms that spawn such Chests or Sacks when Isaac pressed a hidden switch, etc.).
