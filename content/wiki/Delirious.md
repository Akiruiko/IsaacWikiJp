 # Delirious ![image](/image/Delirious.png) 


Effect
--------


* Upon use, spawns [Delirium](/wiki/Delirium "Delirium") in a form of a [friendly](/wiki/Friendly "Friendly") [boss](/wiki/Boss "Boss") for the current room.
* Changes the appearance of the current room so it looks like a different [chapter](/wiki/Chapter "Chapter").


Notes
-------


* If multiple bosses are spawned in one room with [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"), [![image](/image/The_Battery.png)](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery") [The Battery](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery"), or batteries, the bosses can try to kill each other.
* Sometimes bosses don't spawn because of grid entities getting in the way. When this happens the upper door appears to have friendly particles.
* (Removed in Repentance) Unlike [![image](/image/Mega_Blast.png)](/wiki/Mega_Blast "Mega Blast") [Mega Blast](/wiki/Mega_Blast "Mega Blast"), this item can be charged with a single Lil' Battery.
* It is possible for [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush") to spawn, despite Delirium not transforming into Hush during its boss battle.
* If a boss summons monsters, the monsters will be charmed and will follow Isaac out of the room.
* Delirious has a 60% decreased item pool weight, making it less likely to appear than other collectibles.
