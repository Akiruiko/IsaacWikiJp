 # Ouroboros Worm ![image](/image/Ouroboros_Worm.png) 

Effects
---------


* Tears travel in a large spiral pattern.
* Grants [spectral tears](/wiki/Tear_Effects#Spectral "Tear Effects").
* (Removed in Repentance) +4.0 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
	+ (Added in Repentance) +1.5 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
* +2.0 [tear height](/wiki/Tear_height "Tear height").
* A [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck")-based chance for a [homing](/wiki/Tear_Effects#Homing "Tear Effects") shot, reaching 100% at 9 luck.
	+ The homing shots are not different in appearance.
	+ The homing does not override the spiral pattern, making them still unreliable.


Synergies
-----------


* [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Since the bombs don't follow the spiral pattern, only the extra range, spectral bombs, and chance for a homing bomb apply.
* [(Tractor Beam)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): The tears follow a straight path, ignoring the spiral pattern; the tears also stall at a specific point, giving a greater chance to land tears.


Interactions
--------------


* (Removed in Repentance)  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel"): Increases the range of his short-ranged Brimstone. No homing chance.
	+ (Added in Repentance) His Brimstone now spins.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Overrides Ouroboros Worm.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The Brimstone laser is shot in a spiral pattern. Homing does take effect, but is hardly noticeable.
* [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): The tear spirals around in a difficult to control manner, with the added homing chance further complicating things.
* (Removed in Repentance)[(Mom's Knife)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Overrides Ouroboros Worm.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Works as intended. The homing, however, is questionable.
* [(Proptosis)](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") [Proptosis](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis"): The curious pattern allows dealing full damage from a safer range.
* [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel"): His Brimstone laser is shot in a spiral pattern. Homing does take effect, but is hardly noticeable.
* (Removed in Repentance)[(Tech X)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): Overrides Ouroboros Worm.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Tech X now inherits the homing chance benefit, without being affected by the pattern.
* (Removed in Repentance)[(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"): Grants [spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears") without a change in pattern or a chance of homing shots.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The tech laser is now affected by the pattern. The homing DOES take affect, but it's fairly hard to notice.
