 # Lil Portal ![image](/image/Lil_Portal.png) 


Effects
---------


* Summons a portal familiar that launches itself in the direction Isaac shoots to deal contact damage to enemies.
* The portal will consume all pickups and trinkets in its path, converting them into [blue flies](/wiki/Blue_fly "Blue fly") and causing the familiar to become larger and deal more contact damage.
	+ Lil Portal deals contact damage equal to (2x consumables destroyed count + 2), and ticks up to 10 times per second.
	+ When the familiar consumes four pickups, it will summon a portal that leads to an unexplored room on the current floor and its damage bonus is reset.
		- The portal cannot lead to the floor's (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room")/(Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room"), (Ultra Secret Room) [Ultra Secret Room](/wiki/Ultra_Secret_Room "Ultra Secret Room"), entrance to the alt-path, (Black Market) [Black Market](/wiki/Black_Market "Black Market"), or (I AM ERROR) [I AM ERROR](/wiki/I_AM_ERROR "I AM ERROR") Room.


Notes
-------


* Lil Portal doesn't consume pickups or damage enemies it passes over while trailing behind Isaac; it only does so while being launched.
* Lil Portal cannot be launched over [Rocks or Metal Blocks](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles").
* The room portals take Isaac to is determined at the time they're created; if Isaac clears the room the portal would take him to, he will still be taken to that room if he uses it.
* If every room has been explored, portals summoned by the familiar will do nothing and Isaac will jump up and down in them in a purely cosmetic effect. Same effect occurs if a portal is summoned in rooms that doesn't appear on map, as Mom's Heart room in [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum")/[(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") II.
* Portals can lead to (Curse Room) [Curse Rooms](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room"), forcing Isaac to take damage in order to leave.
* (Secret Room) [Secret Rooms](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") and (Boss Challenge Room) [Boss Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Boss_Challenge_Room "Boss Challenge Room") can be entered for free by making a portal after all other rooms on the floor are cleared.
* Portals will persist after Isaac uses them or leaves the room, and will always lead to the same room.
	+ Portals do not respect pathing rules, and can spawn on single-tile walkways and in front of doors, forcing Isaac to use them and preventing him from leaving the room through that door. This can cause a softlock depending on what door it blocks and where the portal leads.
