 # Trisagion ![image](/image/Trisagion.png) 

Effects
---------


* Tears are replaced with [piercing](/wiki/Tear_Effects#Piercing "Tear Effects") white blasts of light.
	+ Blasts deal 33% of the regular [tear damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage"), but can hit the same enemy multiple times.
	+ Blasts decrease in size until disappearing.
		- Despite the blasts decreasing in size after passing through obstacles, this is aesthetic as the blast will only damage enemies adjacent to the obstacle.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Blasts do not knock back enemies.


Notes
-------


* Since the blasts can strike one enemy multiple times, low shot speed can be very beneficial whereas high shot speed may lower effective damage.
	+ Walking backward while firing can allow tears to move slower, making it useful for increasing damage output.
* Items that grant a high Tears rate, such as [![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"), can cause the light beams to significantly obstruct visibility, which can further be exacerbated by items such as [![image](/image/Fruit_Cake.png)](/wiki/Fruit_Cake "Fruit Cake") [Fruit Cake](/wiki/Fruit_Cake "Fruit Cake") causing rapid color and size change.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/8_Inch_Nails.png)](/wiki/8_Inch_Nails "8 Inch Nails") [8 Inch Nails](/wiki/8_Inch_Nails "8 Inch Nails") / [(Blister)](/wiki/Blister "Blister") [Blister](/wiki/Blister "Blister") / [![image](/image/Pisces.png)](/wiki/Pisces "Pisces") [Pisces](/wiki/Pisces "Pisces"): Adds knockback to blasts, which can not only significantly repel enemies when used correctly, it can deal a high amount of damage to enemies unable to escape the knockback.
* [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): Fully charged Trisagion blasts deal 4 times more damage, exceeding Isaac's normal damage.
* [![image](/image/Evil_Eye.png)](/wiki/Evil_Eye "Evil Eye") [Evil Eye](/wiki/Evil_Eye "Evil Eye"): Eyes will fire beams. Occasionally causes Trisagion beams to stay static in the air for a few seconds, dealing damage to enemies that come in contact with them.
* [![image](/image/Godhead.png)](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead") [Godhead](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead"): Although the damaging aura isn't visible, it still exists and is not affected by Trisagion's damage reduction.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The aura is invisible and extremely small. It is unlikely to get any meaningful extra damage from it.
* [(Guppy)](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy") [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy"): As it hits multiple times, it spawns multiple flies per tear making it very strong.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Haemolacria.png)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): Both Trisagion and Haemolacria fire at the same time; Isaac's tears do not keep the spectral attribute despite the sprite being changed. The tears keeps their piercing effect.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Haemolacria becomes one big Trisagion beam that splits into more beams when it reaches its max range.
* [![image](/image/Head_of_the_Keeper.png)](/wiki/Head_of_the_Keeper "Head of the Keeper") [Head of the Keeper](/wiki/Head_of_the_Keeper "Head of the Keeper"): Each tick of damage has a chance to drop coins greatly increasing the amount of coins that would usually drop.
* [Homing tears](/wiki/Homing_tears "Homing tears"): Tears slow down and stay on top of the enemy, doing continuous damage.
* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): The beam becomes controllable, still dealing reduced damage but at a very high rate.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Mucormycosis.png)](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis") [Mucormycosis](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis"): The spore effect can stack multiple times on the same enemy.
* [![image](/image/My_Reflection.png)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection"): In addition to the usual effect, lengthens the Trisagion blasts into short flexible beams for a much larger damage-dealing area.
* [![image](/image/Mysterious_Liquid.png)](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid") [Mysterious Liquid](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid"): Causes a large trail of creep. The effect stacks, which causes heavy damage (even to [(Hush)](/wiki/Hush "Hush") [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush")).
* [![image](/image/Proptosis.png)](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") [Proptosis](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis"): Base damage is increased by the expected amount and beam damage is boosted to about 65%. Blasts lose no power as they travel further, though the tips of the blasts deal very slightly less damage.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spirit_Sword.png)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword"): The sword will shoot Trisagion beams instead of energy beams, with the Trisagion beams having increased damage.

* [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") / [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") / [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") / [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") / [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") / [![image](/image/Tech_X.png)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") / [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"): Overrides Trisagion.
* [![image](/image/Compound_Fracture.png)](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") [Compound Fracture](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture"): Split blasts are not generated on hitting enemies, only on obstacles and walls.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body"): Split blasts are not generated on hitting enemies, only on obstacles, walls, and the floor.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Constantly shoots beams in cardinal directions during its travel time.
* [![image](/image/Dead_Eye.png)](/wiki/Dead_Eye "Dead Eye") [Dead Eye](/wiki/Dead_Eye "Dead Eye") / [![image](/image/Eye_of_Belial.png)](/wiki/Eye_of_Belial "Eye of Belial") [Eye of Belial](/wiki/Eye_of_Belial "Eye of Belial") / (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Euthanasia.png)](/wiki/Euthanasia "Euthanasia") [Euthanasia](/wiki/Euthanasia "Euthanasia") / (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Holy_Light.png)](/wiki/Holy_Light "Holy Light") [Holy Light](/wiki/Holy_Light "Holy Light") / (Removed in Repentance)[(Nose Goblin)](/wiki/Nose_Goblin "Nose Goblin") [Nose Goblin](/wiki/Nose_Goblin "Nose Goblin") / (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Sinus_Infection.png)](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") [Sinus Infection](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") / [![image](/image/Parasitoid.png)](/wiki/Parasitoid "Parasitoid") [Parasitoid](/wiki/Parasitoid "Parasitoid"): Overridden by Trisagion.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Beams can apply the effects of Euthanasia, Holy Light, Nose Goblin, and Sinus Infection on each damage tick, in rapid succession.
* [![image](/image/Fire_Mind.png)](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind") [Fire Mind](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind"): Tears still ignite enemies, but no longer have a chance to explode.
* [![image](/image/Flat_Stone.png)](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone") [Flat Stone](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone"): Blasts continually disappear and reappear as they "bounce". The bounces deal 25% splash damage based on Isaac's base rating, but the blasts cannot do their damage while they're disappearing, leading to an overall reduced efficiency.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Beams will now travel through obstacles and maintain their piercing effect dealing 33% of regular damage to enemies they come in contact with, but won't explode on hit. The Ipecac explosion will happen once the beam runs out of range or hits a wall and will deal damage equal to Isaac's damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Keeps Ipecac's stats and shoots an exploding Trisagion beam. The beam explodes while in contact with an obstacle or an enemy that it does not kill on the first tick, resulting in an excellent synergy with [![image](/image/Pyromaniac.png)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") or [![image](/image/Host_Hat.png)](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") [Host Hat](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat"). One tick of the beam deals 33% of Ipecac's damage to enemies, but the resulting explosion every tick deals full damage.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Jacob%27s_Ladder.png)](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder") [Jacob's Ladder](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder"): Electric arcs are not generated on hitting enemies, only on obstacles and walls.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Small electric arcs generate from the blast every tick
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Lachryphagy.png)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): The blasts will slow down and float like Lachryphagy tears and eventually burst, but can not consume each other.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Blasts have greatly reduced range, but constantly generates Lachryphagy tears, with one shot alone being capable of bursting a tear.
* [![image](/image/A_Lump_of_Coal.png)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal"): Nearly no effect; increases damage by around 5% when the hit is dealt by the tip of the blast. Makes the blasts absorb light, making it difficult to see anything while [Curse of Darkness](/wiki/Curses "Curses") is present.
	+ **A Lump of Coal** + [![image](/image/My_Reflection.png)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection"): As the beam is longer, the amount of extra damage at the tip can be up to around 50%.
* [![image](/image/Multidimensional_Baby.png)](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby"): The baby cannot duplicate Trisagion blasts.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Ocular_Rift.png)](/wiki/Ocular_Rift "Ocular Rift") [Ocular Rift](/wiki/Ocular_Rift "Ocular Rift"): Creates multiple rifts on the blast's trajectory.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/The_Parasite.png)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Split blasts are not generated on hitting enemies, only on obstacles and walls.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Two sideways blasts accompany the beam, effectively increasing horizontal range.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Playdough_Cookie.png)](/wiki/Playdough_Cookie "Playdough Cookie") [Playdough Cookie](/wiki/Playdough_Cookie "Playdough Cookie"): Rather than applying the effect to each individual tear, all beams will share the same color and change simultaneously every tick.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Pop!.png)](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") [Pop!](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!"): The blasts will slow down and float like Pop! tears, but will not bounce off each other.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Every damage tick will shoot out a Pop! tear. Trisagion shots will also hover in the air longer than normal.
* [![image](/image/Technology_Zero.png)](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero") [Technology Zero](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero"): Unless Isaac has shooting familiars, Technology Zero will not function. Familiars' tears will be connected to the blasts with electricity, however.
