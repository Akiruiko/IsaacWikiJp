Effect[]
--------


* Upon use, spawns a special cube-shaped [Movable TNT](/wiki/Movable_TNT "Movable TNT").
* If used a second time while the created TNT is still active, it will explode. This will consume a charge to remotely detonate the TNT instead of creating another TNT.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The remote detonation can be used while the item is uncharged.


Synergies[]
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns one glowing green wisp that cannot take or deal damage in any way, and bounces around the room in a random direction, instead of following Isaac. If the wisp is shot by Isaac or his familiars, it explodes, dealing 100 damage to nearby enemies. The wisp does not persist between rooms. Explosions and enemy shots do not detonate it, and the wisps' explosions are unaffected by [(BFFS!)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") and bomb synergies.


Interactions[]
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[(120 Volt)](/wiki/120_Volt "120 Volt") [120 Volt](/wiki/120_Volt "120 Volt"): The TNT is spawned and then instantly detonated by 120 Volt's electric shock, inflicting 1 full heart of damage.
* (Removed in Afterbirth †) [(Car Battery)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): The TNT will be spawned and then instantly explode, dealing a full heart of damage.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) Spawns two TNT barrels.
* [(Midas' Touch)](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") [Midas' Touch](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch"): Occasionally spawns a golden TNT barrel which turns into a regular movable TNT after 3 seconds. While in its gold state, Isaac cannot collide with the barrel nor push it, although it can be pushed by enemies. In some cases, the golden barrel will explode immediately after spawning, dealing damage to Isaac. Apart from that, it doesn't give any benefits to the player.
