 # Blind Rage ![image](/image/Blind_Rage.png) 

Effect
--------


* Doubles the invincibility frames Isaac gets after getting hit.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) This item makes it possible to use the [Blood Donation Machine](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine") twice without taking damage the second time.
* (Removed in Repentance) This item makes it possible to use the [Devil Beggar](/wiki/Devil_Beggar "Devil Beggar") three times without taking damage the second and third times.
* The invicibility frames also get doubled when effects such as [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") are triggered, making it very useful for  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost").
