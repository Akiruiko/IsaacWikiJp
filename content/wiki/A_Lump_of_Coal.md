Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Does not return extra lives.
* If the Glowing Hour Glass to go back in time to previous room, without moving to another room after the activation, each use will multiply some [familiars](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that persist through rooms by duplicating them. (This is possibly a bug)
	+ Familiars that can be multiplied:
		- [Blood Clots](/wiki/Tainted_Eve#Blood_Clots "Tainted Eve") from  [(Tainted Eve)](/wiki/Tainted_Eve "Tainted Eve") [Tainted Eve](/wiki/Tainted_Eve "Tainted Eve")/(Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Sumptorium.png)](/wiki/Sumptorium "Sumptorium") [Sumptorium](/wiki/Sumptorium "Sumptorium")
		- Blue [flies](/wiki/Familiar#Blue_Flies "Familiar") and [spiders](/wiki/Familiar#Blue_Spiders "Familiar")
		- (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Abyss.png)](/wiki/Abyss "Abyss") [Abyss](/wiki/Abyss "Abyss") locusts
		- [Friendly](/wiki/Friendly "Friendly") monsters spawned by items (i.e. (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Friend_Finder.png)](/wiki/Friend_Finder "Friend Finder") [Friend Finder](/wiki/Friend_Finder "Friend Finder"))
		- Mini-Isaacs spawned by (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Giant_Cell.png)](/wiki/Giant_Cell "Giant Cell") [Giant Cell](/wiki/Giant_Cell "Giant Cell")
		- [Wisps](/wiki/Wisps.xml "Wisps.xml")
			* Wisps from (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Vengeful_Spirit.png)](/wiki/Vengeful_Spirit "Vengeful Spirit") [Vengeful Spirit](/wiki/Vengeful_Spirit "Vengeful Spirit") act very unusual, they appear at the entrance of each room Isaac enters and shoot in the direction that Isaac currently shooting. Wisps from the (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") that exceed the limit of 26 wisps will have this same behavior.
				+ (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Lemegeton.png)](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") [Lemegeton](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") wisps, however, do not retain this behavior and will still spin around Isaac even if they exceed they limit of 26 possible wisps, they also only multiply existing ones.
	+ There appears to be a limit to the number of familiars that can be gained through this method.
* Using a [(Joker)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Joker") [Joker](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") and then the Glowing Hour Glass to return does not guarantee a Devil Room for every floor as the Joker card does not get refunded. The reason for this is that you immediately change rooms after the Joker card is used, as such reverting to before it was used is impossible.
* Does not return health lost entering or leaving a [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room"), as the health was lost in the previous room.
* (Removed in Repentance) Does not return keys or health used to enter [special rooms](/wiki/Rooms#Special_rooms "Rooms").
* Does not preserve the Devil Room or Angel Room door if used to return to the Boss Room.
* Does not turn a character back into another should they have been revived by [![image](/image/Ankh.png)](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") [Ankh](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh"), [![image](/image/Lazarus%27_Rags.png)](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags") [Lazarus' Rags](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags"), or [![image](/image/Judas%27_Shadow.png)](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow") [Judas' Shadow](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow").
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) Character changes are reverted by Glowing Hour Glass.
* (Added in Afterbirth †) Does not affect the chance for a portal to [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") to spawn (the portal will not spawn if it didn't spawn initially).
	+ Does not affect the chance for a [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") or [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") to spawn (it will not spawn if it didn’t initially)
* (Removed in Afterbirth †) Donations to the [Donation Machine](/wiki/Donation_Machine "Donation Machine") or [Greed Machine](/wiki/Greed_Machine "Greed Machine") are not reverted, and they can be reset into a working state once jammed.
	+ Other counters not tied to your specific run, such as [Slot Machines](/wiki/Slot_Machine "Slot Machine") or [Tinted Rocks](/wiki/Tinted_Rock "Tinted Rock") destroyed, continue to accumulate, allowing easy unlocking of secrets such as the [(Counterfeit Penny)](/wiki/Counterfeit_Penny "Counterfeit Penny") [Counterfeit Penny](/wiki/Counterfeit_Penny "Counterfeit Penny"), the [![image](/image/D4.png)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4"), and [Conquest](/wiki/Conquest "Conquest") if you have access to infinite uses of the Glowing Hour Glass (see below).
* With the Curse of the Blind, Glowing Hour Glass can be used to pick up or purchase an unknown item to see what it is, then decide whether or not to undo picking it up.
* Using the Glowing Hour Glass to prevent picking the Glowing Hour Glass up while previously having had an active item will return the active item and discharge it completely.
* No Damage Achievements are still available if the Glowing Hour Glass is used to reset damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance)[(Perfection)](/wiki/Perfection "Perfection") [Perfection](/wiki/Perfection "Perfection") is still able to drop if the Glowing Hour Glass is used to reset damage.
* (Removed in Afterbirth †) Isaac's [temporary familiars](/wiki/Temporary_familiar "Temporary familiar") (Blue Flies and Spiders) duplicate when using the Glowing Hour Glass.
	+ If combined with [![image](/image/The_Battery.png)](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery") [The Battery](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery") or [![image](/image/Sharp_Plug.png)](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug") [Sharp Plug](/wiki/Sharp_Plug "Sharp Plug") while Blue Spiders are present, this combo can generate an infinite army of Blue Spiders.
* The Retro Vision [Pill](/wiki/Pill "Pill") will continue to affect the game even after using the Glowing Hour Glass.
* (Removed in Repentance) Can be used to unlock multiple achievements tied to the killing of certain bosses such as [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") / [It Lives](/wiki/It_Lives "It Lives").
* If there is a Lil' Battery in a Shop, the Glowing Hour Glass can be used infinitely, by entering the Shop without a charge and using the Lil' Battery to recharge and exit the shop. This is useful for duplicating temporary familiars or filling up the Donation Machine, among other uses.
* (Removed in Repentance) Using the Glowing Hour Glass right after beating [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") / [It Lives](/wiki/It_Lives "It Lives") / [Ultra Greed](/wiki/Ultra_Greed "Ultra Greed") allows you to get additional Eden tokens.
* (Removed in Repentance) If a new game is started and  [(Eden)](/wiki/Eden "Eden") [Eden](/wiki/Eden "Eden") begins with this item, using it in the first room will cause the game to crash.
* Does not remove [collection page](/wiki/Collection_page "Collection page") entries if it undoes collecting an item for the first time.
* (Added in Repentance) Using the Glowing Hour Glass after beating Mom's Heart in [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum")/[(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") II will transport the player to the previous room without the Knife Pieces, but the door to Mom's Heart will also be closed. The following floor will be [(Womb)](/wiki/Womb "Womb") [Womb](/wiki/Womb "Womb")/[(Utero)](/wiki/Utero "Utero") [Utero](/wiki/Utero "Utero")/[(Scarred Womb)](/wiki/Scarred_Womb "Scarred Womb") [Scarred Womb](/wiki/Scarred_Womb "Scarred Womb") and not [(Corpse)](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse") [Corpse](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse").
* (Added in Repentance) Using the Glowing Hour Glass after entering a new floor will teleport you back to the boss room of the previous floor.
* (Added in Repentance)  [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany")'s soul heart container does **not** get reset upon activating this item.
* (Added in Repentance) If  [(Tainted Jacob)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") [Tainted Jacob](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") is hit by Esau, using the Glowing Hour Glass will return him to normal form in the previous room.
* (Added in Repentance) The guaranteed angel room chance can be preserved if the item is used after entering the first devil room.
* (Added in Repentance) If used during [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") fight, it will teleport Isaac to the center of the room and have no further effect.
* (Added in Repentance) May be helpful for finding [Planetariums](/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium"), as it lets the player effectively skip item rooms while also seeing if what's inside them is worth taking.
* (Added in Repentance) The chance of a [Planetarium](/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium") generating on future floors can be preserved if Isaac enters one for the first time and then uses Glowing Hour Glass to leave, effectively allowing Isaac to reroll his Planetarium until a desired item is found.
