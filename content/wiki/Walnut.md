 # Walnut ![image](/image/Walnut.png) 

Effects
---------


* After Isaac is hit by 1-9 explosions, the Walnut will be destroyed and spawns a [coin](/wiki/Coin "Coin"), a [heart](/wiki/Heart "Heart"), a [key](/wiki/Key "Key") and another [trinket](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket"). The pickups may be of any normal variety.


Notes
-------


* Taking damage from the explosion is not required to trigger the effect.


Synergies
-----------


* [(Bomber Boy)](/wiki/Bomber_Boy "Bomber Boy") [Bomber Boy](/wiki/Bomber_Boy "Bomber Boy"): As Bomber Boy causes 9 explosions at once, laying a bomb and not moving before it explodes will always trigger the trinket.
* [(Gnawed Leaf)](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf") [Gnawed Leaf](/wiki/Gnawed_Leaf "Gnawed Leaf"): Isaac will not be knockbacked from the explosions, but it will count for the trinket.
* [(Host Hat)](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") [Host Hat](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") / [(Pyromaniac)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac"): Not only will Isaac become immune to explosions, but the amount of required hits is reduced to 1-5.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Smelter)](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter"): Walnut will still only activate once after being absorbed.
