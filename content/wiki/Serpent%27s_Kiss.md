Notes
-------


* Not affected by [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").

* Enemies and bosses with multiple segments, such as Chub and Larry Jr., have a chance to drop multiple Black Hearts.
* The enemy does not need to be killed by the poison or still be poisoned when killed for the Black Hearts to drop.
* (Removed in Afterbirth †) Although [Stonies](/wiki/Stoney "Stoney") and [Shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper") can't be visibly poisoned, they still can drop Black Hearts if destroyed after being touched.
* If a boss would have been poisoned, but negates it with status immunity, they can still drop a black heart.
