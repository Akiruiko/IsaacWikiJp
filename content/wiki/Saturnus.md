Effects[]
---------


* A circle surrounds Isaac. When entering a room, the circle is filled with 7 orbiting tears that copy Isaac's tear properties.
	+ The tears will deal 1.5x Isaac's damage +5 flat damage.
	+ After 13 seconds, the tears will automatically fall to the ground.
	+ Orbiting tears are [spectral](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears"), although they don't visually appear to be.
	+ The room does not have to be a new room to renew the 7 orbiting tears.
* Enemy tears have a chance to be caught in the orbit, making them able to damage enemies.
	+ Enemy tears caught only last for the current room.


Notes[]
-------


* Any new effect on tears provided by an item or a trinket won't affect Ring tears until getting to a new room.
	+ This is the same for lost effects (eg. by dropping a trinket).
* When using a teleporter in [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum")/[(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna"), the tears won't teleport and instead travel back towards the ring.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Angelic Prism)](/wiki/Angelic_Prism "Angelic Prism") [Angelic Prism](/wiki/Angelic_Prism "Angelic Prism"): Prism and tears share the same orbit, making them easy to split.
* [(Blood Clot)](/wiki/Blood_Clot "Blood Clot") [Blood Clot](/wiki/Blood_Clot "Blood Clot")/[(Chemical Peel)](/wiki/Chemical_Peel "Chemical Peel") [Chemical Peel](/wiki/Chemical_Peel "Chemical Peel"): Orbiting tears will be the same than the last fired tear before leaving the previous room.
	+ Having an item that randomly applies the bonus ([(Mom's Knife)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"), [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"), [(Stapler)](/wiki/Stapler "Stapler") [Stapler](/wiki/Stapler "Stapler"), ect), will give each tear a 50% chance to have the bonus.
* [(Godhead)](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead") [Godhead](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead"): The orbiting tears have Godhead's damaging aura without the homing effect.
* [Homing tears](/wiki/Homing_tears "Homing tears"): Tears will break orbit to home into nearby enemies. With [piercing](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears"), tears will return to the orbit after dealing damage.
* [(A Lump of Coal)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal"): The tears grow in size and damage as they orbit around Isaac.

Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): No effect.
* [(Crown of Light)](/wiki/Crown_of_Light "Crown of Light") [Crown of Light](/wiki/Crown_of_Light "Crown of Light"): Functions as intended, but the tears surrounding Isaac will appear normal.
* [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): No effect; tears surrounding Isaac will be regular tears.
* [(Explosivo)](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo") [Explosivo](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo"): Orbiting tears that stick to an enemy but don't detonate will return to the ring if the enemy cannot be stuck to anymore.
* [(Hook Worm)](/wiki/Hook_Worm "Hook Worm") [Hook Worm](/wiki/Hook_Worm "Hook Worm"): No effect upon ring's tear.
* [(Ipecac)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Tears surrounding Isaac will not cause self damage if at maximum distance until high tear size. If Isaac enters a room and his Saturnus tears have not spread out, they could hit an entity and cause self damage.

* [(Sulfuric Acid)](/wiki/Sulfuric_Acid "Sulfuric Acid") [Sulfuric Acid](/wiki/Sulfuric_Acid "Sulfuric Acid") / [(Terra)](/wiki/Terra "Terra") [Terra](/wiki/Terra "Terra"): As the orbiting tears can destroy rocks, Isaac can unintentionally detonate [Bomb Rocks](/wiki/Rocks#Bomb_Rocks "Rocks"), causing self damage.
* [(Tractor Beam)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): No effect on surrounding tears.
