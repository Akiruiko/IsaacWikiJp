Effects
---------


* Gives Isaac a flat +0.75 [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears") even past the normal cap, -0.03 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed"), and distorts the screen and background music. The effects can be stacked in the same room, and the distortion becomes more pronounced with repeated use. After repeated uses, the colors begin to turn very bright and intense.
	+ Each use increases the recharge time, which starts at 0.5 seconds with the 1st use, and ends with 15 seconds on the 9th use. After the 10th use, it no longer recharges automatically though it can be recharged and used even more through [batteries](/wiki/Batteries "Batteries").
	+ Leaving the room doubles the speed penalty and multiplies the tears bonus by x0.4, for the uses in that room.
	+ Clearing a room removes one use's worth of penalties and bonuses, giving +0.06 speed and -0.3 tears.
	+ Isaac's costume will change the stronger the Item's effects get.
* This item belongs to the [Fun Guy](/wiki/Fun_Guy "Fun Guy") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a walking mushroom.
