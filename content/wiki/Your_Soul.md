 # Your Soul ![image](/image/Your_Soul.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants 1 free [Devil Deal](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") item in exchange for the trinket.
	+ After a Devil Deal has been taken, the trinket is removed from Isaac's inventory.
	+ Also works in [Black Markets](/wiki/Black_Market "Black Market") and all other places where [heart containers](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health") can be exchanged for an item.


Notes
-------


* Your Soul has no effect on Devil Deals that cost money instead of health, such as from [![image](/image/Keeper%27s_Bargain.png)](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Bargain "Keeper's Bargain") [Keeper's Bargain](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Bargain "Keeper's Bargain").
* Using Your Soul as  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") /  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") grants the possibility of taking two items from the Devil Deal instead of only one.
* Using Your Soul still counts as taking a Devil Deal for the purpose of determining [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") eligibility.


Interactions
