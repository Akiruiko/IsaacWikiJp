Effect[]
--------


* Spawns a conjoined [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar"), much like [Gemini](/wiki/Gemini "Gemini")'s small twin, Suture. It chases enemies close to Isaac, dealing 3 damage per tick (~8 damage per second).


Notes[]
-------


* Despite its appearance and description, Gemini does not count towards the [conjoined](/wiki/Conjoined "Conjoined") transformation.


Interaction[]
-------------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Duct Tape)](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape") [Duct Tape](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape"): The familiar will stay in place relative to Isaac, but the effect of chasing enemies persists.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(King Baby)](/wiki/King_Baby "King Baby") [King Baby](/wiki/King_Baby "King Baby"): Suture will rest near King Baby if there are no enemies near Isaac, but will snap towards the enemy once one gets close enough to Isaac. Otherwise, no functional difference.
* (Added in Repentance)[(RC Remote)](/wiki/RC_Remote "RC Remote") [RC Remote](/wiki/RC_Remote "RC Remote"): The familiar can be extended way past its attack range, and will still do contact damage, but will only chase when an enemy enters the usual aggro distance.
