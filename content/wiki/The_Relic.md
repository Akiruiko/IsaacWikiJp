Effects[]
---------


* Upon use, Lemegeton will grant a random [passive item](/wiki/Passive_item "Passive item") as an orbital familiar. The item summoned has a 25% chance to be from the current room's [Item Pool](/wiki/Item_Pool "Item Pool"), or from a random item pool otherwise. The item must have the ['`summonable`' item tag](/wiki/Item_Tags_summonable "Item Tags summonable") in order to be generated.
	+ These familiars can block up to 4 shots and/or get hit by 2 explosions before being destroyed. When the familiar is destroyed, the item it granted is lost.
		- If Isaac is [shielded or invulnerable](/wiki/Temporary_Buffs "Temporary Buffs"), his familiars are also immune to damage.
	+ Familiars also deal contact damage to enemies equal to 2x Isaac's damage per tick (4x Isaac's damage per second). They do take contact damage.
	+ Isaac can have up to 24 familiars: an inner counterclockwise ring of 6, a middle clockwise ring with 8, and an outer counterclockwise ring of 10.
		- Using Lemegeton while Isaac already has 24 causes the oldest one to be replaced.
* This item belongs to the [Bookworm](/wiki/Bookworm "Bookworm") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Bookworm.


Notes[]
-------


* [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") starts with this item in the consumable slot.
	+ When playing as Tainted Bethany, picking up [(4.5 Volt)](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") [4.5 Volt](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") will cause Lemegeton to no longer gain charges as long as her normal active item has empty charges.
* Although [(Delirious)](/wiki/Delirious "Delirious") [Delirious](/wiki/Delirious "Delirious") and [(Mr. ME!)](/wiki/Mr._ME! "Mr. ME!") [Mr. ME!](/wiki/Mr._ME! "Mr. ME!") are marked as summonable, their wisps do nothing and grant no effects.
* Items given by Lemegeton are separate from the normal item pools and Isaac's current collection of items. This has the following effects:
	+ Isaac can still normally find items that were previously summoned by Lemegeton.
	+ Isaac can have multiple wisps of the same item.
	+ Wisps cannot be rerolled by [(Missing No.)](/wiki/Missing_No. "Missing No.") [Missing No.](/wiki/Missing_No. "Missing No.") or the [(D4)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4") / [(D100)](/wiki/D100 "D100") [D100](/wiki/D100 "D100").
	+ Wisps do not count towards [transformations](/wiki/Transformation "Transformation").
	+ Summoned items do not count towards the [Collection Page](/wiki/Collection_Page "Collection Page").
* Items that would normally add or remove hearts/consumables (such as [(Boom!)](/wiki/Boom! "Boom!") [Boom!](/wiki/Boom! "Boom!"), [(Breakfast)](/wiki/Breakfast "Breakfast") [Breakfast](/wiki/Breakfast "Breakfast"), [(Abaddon)](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") [Abaddon](/wiki/Abaddon "Abaddon") etc.) do not do so if given by Lemegeton.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Lets Lemegeton's wisps shoot homing tears once per second that deal 3 damage.
* [(Rock Bottom)](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom") [Rock Bottom](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom"): Stat increases remain even after its wisp has been destroyed.
* [(Satanic Bible)](/wiki/Satanic_Bible "Satanic Bible") [Satanic Bible](/wiki/Satanic_Bible "Satanic Bible"): Using Lemegeton in a (Boss Room) [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_Room "Boss Room") after activating the Satanic Bible on that floor will pull from the [Devil Room item pool](/wiki/Devil_Room_(Item_Pool) "Devil Room (Item Pool)"), even if the boss wouldn't normally drop an item after defeat.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Chaos)](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos") [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos"): Item wisps will be selected from random pools, regardless of the room Isaac is in.
* [(Magic Skin)](/wiki/Magic_Skin "Magic Skin") [Magic Skin](/wiki/Magic_Skin "Magic Skin"): Can be spawned by Lemegeton if it has been used in the current run.
* [(Rosary)](/wiki/Rosary "Rosary") [Rosary](/wiki/Rosary "Rosary"): Allows [(The Bible)](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") [The Bible](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") to be summoned by Lemegeton, taking up a slot while not providing anything.
* [(Sacrificial Altar)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar") [Sacrificial Altar](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar"): Every wisp will be converted to a [(Half Soul Heart)](/wiki/Half_Soul_Heart "Half Soul Heart") [Half Soul Heart](/wiki/Half_Soul_Heart "Half Soul Heart"). [Familiars](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") created by Lemegeton are sacrificed normally and also spawn full [(Soul Heart)](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart").
