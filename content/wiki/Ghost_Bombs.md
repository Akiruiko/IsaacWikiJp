 # Ghost Bombs ![image](/image/Ghost_Bombs.png) 

Effects
---------


* Gives Isaac 5 [bombs](/wiki/Bombs "Bombs").
* Isaac's bombs become spectral, and will pass through objects.
* Isaac's bombs create ghosts when they explode, which rapidly chase and deal contact damage to enemies.
	+ The ghost deals contact damage equal to half of Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") per tick (2x Isaac's damage per second).
* After 10 seconds, the ghost explodes, dealing 7 damage to nearby enemies up to 3 times and destroying nearby projectiles. Isaac does not take damage from the explosion.
	+ If there are no enemies in the room, the ghost follows Isaac. However, it cannot follow Isaac between rooms.
