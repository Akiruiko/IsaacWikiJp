 # Beth's Faith ![image](/image/Beth%27s_Faith.png) 

Effects
---------


* At the beginning of each floor, spawn 4 wisps that orbit Isaac and fires tears alongside him. The wisps are the same as the default wisps that spawn with [(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues").


Notes
-------


* If Isaac already has any wisps before entering a new floor, the trinket will only add enough new wisps to bring the total wisps to 8.


Synergies
-----------
