 # There's Options ![image](/image/There%27s_Options.png) 


Effects
---------


* Replaces tears with explosive and [poisoning](/wiki/Poison "Poison") projectiles fired in an arc.
* Tears down - (Delay * 2) + 10
* (Removed in Repentance) +13 Shot Height
* +40 flat damage (See [Effective Damage](/wiki/Damage#Effective_Damage "Damage"))
* Tear size multiplier: 0.4x
* (Added in Repentance) -0.2 [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed").
* (Added in Repentance) Minor range down.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Bob](/wiki/Bob "Bob") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Bob.


Notes
-------


* Enemies within the blast radius of an Ipecac explosion will also be [poisoned](/wiki/Poison "Poison").
* The damage boost mitigates the very small tear size multiplier.
* Ipecac's damage bonus does not apply to Burn or Poison fully; only +4 is applied to their damage per tick.
* Character damage multipliers do not apply to Ipecac's flat bonus.
* Ipecac explosions hurt Isaac for half a heart. Other explosion damage is not affected.
	+ Self-damage is increased to a full heart with 85 or higher damage stat.
* (Added in Repentance) The tear height of the shots scales with range. At base stats, Ipecac shots won't be able to fly over obstacles, but the more range ups Isaac gets, the higher shots will be launched.
* (Added in Repentance) It is possible that with low shot speed and high range/tear height, Isaac won't be able to hit obstacles up close with Ipecac shots.
* (Removed in Repentance) The range of the explosion is a circle roughly 3 blocks in diameter, regardless of damage.
	+ As Ipecac's explosion range does not scale with tear size, with enough tear size increasing items (e.g. [![image](/image/Death%27s_Touch.png)](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch") [Death's Touch](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch")), it can become nearly impossible to hit enemies with Ipecac's explosions.
* (Added in Repentance) Ipecac's explosion range increases with tear size.
* Using Ipecac in a Crawl Space will cause the tear to bounce off the ceiling, bounce off the floor at a low height, and eventually explode. The same applies to using it on a Crawl Space wall.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Apple!.png)](/wiki/Apple! "Apple!") [Apple!](/wiki/Apple! "Apple!"): Chance of having razor replacing Ipecac tears, quadrupling the damage and causing the explosion to shake the screen.


* [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") / [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Blood beam now does poison damage. The character doesn't gain the Damage Up or Tears Down effects.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) Isaac shoots Ipecac tears while charging Brimstone. Both Brimstone and Ipecac shots modify Isaac's damage and tear delay stat, meaning that Ipecac fires slower and Brimstone charges slower, but Brimstone does an extra 40*13 damage. Take care to pre-charge Brimstone so that the Ipecac shot is on cooldown as Isaac enters a room.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Blood beam has a chance to do poison damage and explodes on enemy or obstacle contact. Adds +2 damage, but does not modify Isaac's tear rate stat. [![image](/image/The_Ladder.png)](/wiki/The_Ladder "The Ladder") [The Ladder](/wiki/The_Ladder "The Ladder"), when placed, will trigger the Ipecac-Brimstone explosions. (possibly a bug)
* (Added in Repentance)[(Brain Worm)](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm") [Brain Worm](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm"): The Ipecac tears will snap 90 degrees and rain down at nearby enemy should the shot miss, completely eliminating the shortcoming of having too much range and causing Ipecac tears to fly over enemy's head, missing them.
* [![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body"): The main tear splits into four explosive splash tears. The splash tears can still damage Isaac.
* [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Bombs explode on contact, do no damage to Isaac and become [![image](/image/Bob%27s_Curse.png)](/wiki/Bob%27s_Curse "Bob's Curse") [Bob's Curse](/wiki/Bob%27s_Curse "Bob's Curse") bombs. You no longer get +40 damage. With [Jacob & Esau](/wiki/Jacob_%26_Esau "Jacob & Esau") only the character with the items is immune to the explosions.
	+ **Dr. Fetus** + **Monstro's Lung**: Renders Isaac no longer immune to his shots, also they will explode as soon as Isaac shoots.
	+ **Dr. Fetus** + **Sad Bombs**: Isaac is not immune to the explosive shots created by the Sad Bombs' effect.
* [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Missiles turn green and are poisonous. Damage greatly increases as the flat damage bonus stacks with Epic Fetus' explosive multiplier.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Flat_Stone.png)](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone") [Flat Stone](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone"): The Ipecac shots cause full-damage explosions instead of lesser splash damage when they bounce off the floor, though they can also harm Isaac.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Each bounce creates an explosion that deals half Isaac's damage as well as dealing the regular splash damage. The bounce explosion radius is slightly larger than the splash radius.
* (Added in Afterbirth †) [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): The ghost form uses Ipecac as normal. The skeleton form's melee attacks become poisonous and explosive with +4 flat damage; he cannot be hurt by the blasts but is pushed back by them. The charged boomerang attack is only poisonous.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The charged boomerang attack is now explosive while being sent out, but not while returning. These explosions still do no self-damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) When the skeleton form has [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"), the boomerang attack constantly explodes and deals damage to The Forgotten.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Haemolacria.png)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): Tear delay is increased by 1/3 compared to either of the items on their own, but Isaac now fires Ipecac shots that releases poisonous, high-damage but\non-explosive split tears on impact.
* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Tear damage is increased by 4, explodes when killing an enemy, and comes back to Isaac.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance)+4 damage bonus, no explosion.
	+ (Added in Repentance) +2 damage bonus, no explosion.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Maw_of_the_Void.png)](/wiki/Maw_of_the_Void "Maw of the Void") [Maw of the Void](/wiki/Maw_of_the_Void "Maw of the Void"): The ring has chance to do poison damage and explodes on enemy or obstacle contact.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Mega_Blast.png)](/wiki/Mega_Blast "Mega Blast") [Mega Blast](/wiki/Mega_Blast "Mega Blast"): The explosions from the beam do not damage Isaac.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Knife turns green, may poison enemies, and removes Ipecac's damage increase.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) Also adds +4 damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Also adds +2 damage, explodes on enemy contact if thrown.
* [![image](/image/Monstro%27s_Lung.png)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"): Isaac fires a barrage of Ipecac shots, with no increase in charge time compared to Monstro's Lung alone.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Charge time increases by 3x.
* [![image](/image/Mysterious_Liquid.png)](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid") [Mysterious Liquid](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid"): Leaves a massive pool of [creep](/wiki/Creep "Creep") on the floor on impact.
* [![image](/image/The_Parasite.png)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): The Ipecac tear will spawn two smaller explosive tears when it collides with a solid object, but not with an enemy. These tears can spawn tears on their own as well, potentially leading to huge chain reactions.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Revelation.png)](/wiki/Revelation "Revelation") [Revelation](/wiki/Revelation "Revelation"): The laser will repeatedly explode on contact with an enemy or obstacle.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Tech_X.png)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): The laser ring becomes poisonous and gains +4 damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Explodes repeatedly on contact, adds +2 damage. Knockback from the blasts will push enemies along the path of the ring, prolonging damage.
* [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"): No damage bonus, poisonous laser.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) +4 damage bonus, poisonous laser.
	+ (Added in Repentance) +2 damage bonus, poisonous laser that explodes on enemy or obstacle contact. Keeps Ipecac's stats other than damage.
		- Note: This combination is not advised if the player has the [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") familiar. When the ipecac technology laser passes through the [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby"), it instantly explodes, damaging the player and likely being fatal for the run.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Trisagion.png)](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion") [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion"): The explosive tears from Ipecac are replaced with Trisagion's beams that travel through obstacles and have a piercing effect dealing 33% of regular damage to enemies they come in contact with, but won't explode on hit. The Ipecac explosion will happen once the beam runs out of range or hits a wall and will deal damage equal to Isaac's damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Shoots Trisagion tears, which explode upon impact with an enemy/obstacle.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Crown_of_Light.png)](/wiki/Crown_of_Light "Crown of Light") [Crown of Light](/wiki/Crown_of_Light "Crown of Light") / [![image](/image/Polyphemus.png)](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") [Polyphemus](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") / (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Proptosis.png)](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") [Proptosis](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") / [![image](/image/Sacred_Heart.png)](/wiki/Sacred_Heart "Sacred Heart") [Sacred Heart](/wiki/Sacred_Heart "Sacred Heart") / (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Bloody_Lust.png)](/wiki/Bloody_Lust "Bloody Lust") [Bloody Lust](/wiki/Bloody_Lust "Bloody Lust"): The damage multipliers from these items do not apply to Ipecac's +40 bonus, resulting in much lower damage increase than expected.
* [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): Charged up Ipecac deals expectedly high damage. Rapid-fire can be used against weaker enemies or to clear obstacles when necessary.
* [![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Head.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Head "Cricket's Head") [Cricket's Head](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Head "Cricket's Head") / [![image](/image/Eve%27s_Mascara.png)](/wiki/Eve%27s_Mascara "Eve's Mascara") [Eve's Mascara](/wiki/Eve%27s_Mascara "Eve's Mascara") / [![image](/image/Magic_Mushroom.png)](/wiki/Magic_Mushroom "Magic Mushroom") [Magic Mushroom](/wiki/Magic_Mushroom "Magic Mushroom"): The damage multipliers from these items apply to Ipecac's +40 bonus, unlike others.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Death%27s_Touch.png)](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch") [Death's Touch](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch"): Although damage is increased, the tears' hitboxes also grow larger which may be detrimental.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Tears are no longer ridiculously big. Much safer to use.
* [![image](/image/Fire_Mind.png)](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind") [Fire Mind](/wiki/Fire_Mind "Fire Mind"): Due to the nature of the Ipecac, all shots will have a 100% chance of leaving a fire at the center of the explosion. (Removed in Repentance) It will also no longer leave behind green creep and the explosion will be of normal color instead of green.
* (Removed in Repentance) (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Ghost_Pepper.png)](/wiki/Ghost_Pepper "Ghost Pepper") [Ghost Pepper](/wiki/Ghost_Pepper "Ghost Pepper"): If a fire is generated at the same time as an Ipecac shot, the Ipecac shot will explode instantly.
	+ (Added in Repentance) No longer the case. Same applies with (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Bird%27s_Eye.png)](/wiki/Bird%27s_Eye "Bird's Eye") [Bird's Eye](/wiki/Bird%27s_Eye "Bird's Eye").
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Glass_Cannon.png)](/wiki/Glass_Cannon "Glass Cannon") [Glass Cannon](/wiki/Glass_Cannon "Glass Cannon"): As the Glass Cannon tears are so large, even a modest damage increase or a single tear size increasing item is likely to render the tear unable to damage enemies.
* [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy") transformation: Blue Flies are no longer spawned on hit.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Ipecac shots now spawn Blue Flies on hit, both direct and indirect.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Holy_Light.png)](/wiki/Holy_Light "Holy Light") [Holy Light](/wiki/Holy_Light "Holy Light"): A beam of light will spawn on top of any enemy within the explosion's radius.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Jacob%27s_Ladder.png)](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder") [Jacob's Ladder](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder") Sparks of electricity shoot out only when hitting a wall.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Little_Horn_(Item).png)](/wiki/Little_Horn_(Item) "Little Horn") [Little Horn](/wiki/Little_Horn_(Item) "Little Horn (Item)"): If an Ipecac shot also happens to have the Little Horn effect, after destroying an enemy, it loses its explosive property and effectively is just a normal Little Horn tear.
* [![image](/image/Lost_Contact.png)](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact") [Lost Contact](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact"): Ipecac shots will explode on contact with enemy shots.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Eye.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye") [Mom's Eye](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye") / [![image](/image/Loki%27s_Horns.png)](/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns "Loki's Horns") [Loki's Horns](/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns "Loki's Horns"): Occasionally shoots backwards or in all 4 directions, with high risk of self-damage.
* [Piercing tears](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears"): Tears will still explode on enemy contact, nullifying piercing.
* [![image](/image/Rubber_Cement.png)](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement") [Rubber Cement](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement"): Tears will bounce off walls and rocks and won't explode until they hit the ground. Not recommended, as self-damage is likely.
* [Spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears"): Ipecac shots no longer explode on contact with obstacles or walls, making accidental self-damage less likely but it's more difficult to open secret doors.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"): Tainted Forgotten's melee attacks will explode. Tainted Soul is immune *only* to those explosions, and any further explosions caused by synergies will damage it.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Technology_2.png)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2"): The +40 damage bonus is not affected by the Technology 2 multiplier making the laser very high powered, but only every other Ipecac shot is fired.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The laser no longer inherits the +40 damage, however it is still considerably powerful.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Technology_Zero.png)](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero") [Technology Zero](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero"): High fire rate needed for explosive shots to be connected.
* [![image](/image/Tiny_Planet.png)](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") [Tiny Planet](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet"): Ipecac tears orbit around Isaac for a very long time. They land far enough to not cause self-damage, but that can be relied on only if Isaac is not moving and do not hit enemies.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Tractor_Beam.png)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): The Ipecac tear will travel in an arc along the beam, even if Isaac is moving forward as well. When Isaac changes direction, the tear will snap to the beam, making it very easy to accidentally hit close objects blocking its new path.
