* Bombs spawned by [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") retain the sticky effect of Sticky Bombs, but having an item that pierces enemies, such as [(Death's Touch)](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch") [Death's Touch](/wiki/Death%27s_Touch "Death's Touch"), overrides the effect of Sticky Bombs.
