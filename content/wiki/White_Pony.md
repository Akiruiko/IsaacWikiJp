Effects[]
---------


* Passively grants [flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight").
* If Isaac's [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") is less than 1.5, the item passively increases his speed to 1.5.
* Upon use, Isaac charges in the direction the pony is facing, giving [invincibility](/wiki/Invulnerability "Invulnerability") during the charge and damaging enemies while also causing beams of light (Removed in Repentance) to randomly rain from the sky. These beams of light are identical to those created by [(Crack the Sky)](/wiki/Crack_the_Sky "Crack the Sky") [Crack the Sky](/wiki/Crack_the_Sky "Crack the Sky") (Added in Repentance) except for the damage of them.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The beams of light now deal 4 times Isaac's damage, plus a flat 10 damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The beams of light trail behind Isaac instead of being spaced randomly throughout the room.
* (Removed in Repentance) The dash deals 40 flat contact damage to enemies.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The dash now deals 4 times Isaac's damage, plus a flat 28 damage.
* (Added in Repentance) Isaac can dash through doors, which means damage from [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") doors can be avoided.
	+ Although the dash can persist between rooms, the beams of light only occur in the room it is used in.
* While not time-based, invincibility from White Pony is otherwise identical to damage immunity granted by the [invulnerability](/wiki/Invulnerability "Invulnerability") effect.


Notes[]

	+ White Pony cannot be crafted with the (Added in Repentance)[(Bag of Crafting)](/wiki/Bag_of_Crafting "Bag of Crafting") [Bag of Crafting](/wiki/Bag_of_Crafting "Bag of Crafting").
