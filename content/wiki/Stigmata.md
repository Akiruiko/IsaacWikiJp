Effects[]
---------


* Tears that deal more than 1.0 damage split into two tears with half damage and half remaining range on impact with obstacles or enemies.
	+ Damage less than 1.0 causes the tears to simply disappear.
	+ The splitting can keep up as long as the tears have range remaining and the damage of the split tears stays above 0.5.
	+ Split tears are scaled down by 0.5x from the parent one, ignoring damage based size reduction.
