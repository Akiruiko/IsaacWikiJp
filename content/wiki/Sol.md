Effect[]
--------


* A friendly [Monstro](/wiki/Monstro "Monstro") jumps on a random enemy, dealing 120 damage while destroying nearby [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles") like rocks.


Notes[]
-------


* This item will target Isaac if it is used in a [room](/wiki/Room "Room") without monsters and will cause damage.
* Monstro will target [shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper").
* (Removed in Repentance) Like [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom") and [Satan](/wiki/Satan "Satan")'s stomp attacks, this attack is treated as an explosion, so [(Pyromaniac)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") and (Added in Afterbirth)[(Host Hat)](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") [Host Hat](/wiki/Host_Hat "Host Hat") will be activated if Monstro falls on Isaac.
	+ Due to this, if [Monstro](/wiki/Monstro "Monstro") falls near the entrance to a [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room"), it will be opened. This can be used to open [Secret Rooms](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") for free.
* (Removed in Afterbirth) This item does not affect Monstro.
