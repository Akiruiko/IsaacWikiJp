 # Little Horn ![image](/image/Little_Horn_(Item).png) 


Effects
---------


* (Removed in Repentance) Adds a chance to fire [piercing tears](/wiki/Tear_Effects#Piercing "Tear Effects") which will instantly kill any non-boss enemy.
* (Added in Repentance) Adds a chance to fire a tear that summons [Big Horn](/wiki/Big_Horn "Big Horn")'s hand. It will grab and crush any non-boss enemy, killing them instantly, and attacks bosses 3 times for 12 damage each hit (even [Big Horn](/wiki/Big_Horn "Big Horn") himself).
	+ [Big Horn](/wiki/Big_Horn "Big Horn")'s hand is able to push projectiles of enemies away from the source of contact. These tears gain additional speed. This makes it especially difficult for the player to dodge while fighting [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush"), as it fires a lot of tears and many are propelled by a turning force.
* The chance of firing a special tear is 5% at 0 luck and increases to a maximum of 20% with 15 luck.
* Running into enemies deals 3.5 damage to them.
	+ Damage is dealt up to twice per second per enemy.


Notes
-------


* The special tears will kill some normally invulnerable monsters, such as [Death's Heads](/wiki/Death%27s_Head "Death's Head"), [Stoneys](/wiki/Stoney "Stoney"), and [Peep's](/wiki/Peep "Peep") floating eyeballs.
* The special tears can also destroy [Blue Fire Places](/wiki/Blue_Fire_Place "Blue Fire Place") and [Purple Fire Places](/wiki/Purple_Fire_Place "Purple Fire Place").
* The special tears can destroy the various spiked blocks ([Wall Hugger](/wiki/Wall_Hugger "Wall Hugger"), [Slide](/wiki/Slide "Slide"), and [Poky](/wiki/Poky "Poky")) as well as the variants of [Stone Grimace](/wiki/Stone_Grimace "Stone Grimace"). All of these won't respawn if Isaac leaves and re-enters the room.
* The contact damage effect overrides the superior contact damage from [![image](/image/Aries.png)](/wiki/Aries "Aries") [Aries](/wiki/Aries "Aries"), [![image](/image/The_Gamekid.png)](/wiki/The_Gamekid "The Gamekid") [The Gamekid](/wiki/The_Gamekid "The Gamekid"), [![image](/image/My_Little_Unicorn.png)](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn") [My Little Unicorn](/wiki/My_Little_Unicorn "My Little Unicorn") / [(VII - The Chariot)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "VII - The Chariot") [VII - The Chariot](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), and [![image](/image/The_Nail.png)](/wiki/The_Nail "The Nail") [The Nail](/wiki/The_Nail "The Nail"). Only [![image](/image/Midas%27_Touch.png)](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") [Midas' Touch](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") still works and deals an additional 3.5 damage.
