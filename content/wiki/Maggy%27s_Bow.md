Effects[]
---------


* Allows Isaac to create a (Red Room) **Red Room** by using it next to a wall where there would be no conditions that could prevent a room from spawning there (i.e., the same conditions for a (Secret Room) [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") to spawn). This is indicated by red door outlines on walls.
* These rooms are most commonly normal rooms, but have a 10% chance[[1]](#cite_note-1) to be a [special room](/wiki/Special_room "Special room") instead, even including Red (Devil Room) [Devil Rooms](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") or (Angel Room) [Angel Rooms](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room").
	+ Red special rooms of any kind can appear in every floor.
* These rooms use a special Red Room icon on the map.


Notes[]
-------


* The types of special rooms that a (Red Room) **Red Room** can be are the following:



* (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room")
* (Arcade) [Arcade](/wiki/Arcade "Arcade")
* (Clean Bedroom) [Clean Bedroom](/wiki/Clean_Bedroom "Clean Bedroom")
* (Curse Room) [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room")
* (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room")
* (Dice Room) [Dice Room](/wiki/Dice_Room "Dice Room")
* (Dirty Bedroom) [Dirty Bedroom](/wiki/Dirty_Bedroom "Dirty Bedroom")
* (Library) [Library](/wiki/Library "Library")
* (Mini-Boss Room) [Mini-Boss Room](/wiki/Mini-Boss_Room "Mini-Boss Room")
* (Planetarium) [Planetarium](/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium")
* (Sacrifice Room) [Sacrifice Room](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room")
* (Secret Room) [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room")
* (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop")
* (Super Secret Room) [Super Secret Room](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room")
* (Treasure Room) [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room")
* (Vault) [Vault](/wiki/Vault "Vault")



* All rooms made by Red Key will be 1x1 rooms that can have doors available on all sides (same conditions as a (Secret Room) [Secret Room](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") / (Super Secret Room) [Super Secret Room](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room")).
* In [(Home)](/wiki/Home "Home") [Home](/wiki/Home "Home"), Isaac can create a "Red Room" on the left side of the map right under Mom's room. This room will actually be a closet containing a non-tainted character's [Tainted](/wiki/Tainted_Characters "Tainted Characters") form.
	+ If the respective Tainted character has already been found or a Tainted character is played, the room will contain [(Inner Child)](/wiki/Inner_Child "Inner Child") [Inner Child](/wiki/Inner_Child "Inner Child") instead. If Inner Child has not been unlocked, the room will contain a [Shopkeeper](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper").
* If a door created by Red Key takes Isaac outside of the 13x13 area of the floor, he will be taken to the (I AM ERROR) [I AM ERROR](/wiki/I_AM_ERROR "I AM ERROR") room.
	+ This does not occur in [(Corpse)](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse") [Corpse](/wiki/Corpse "Corpse") II, [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room"), [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)"), [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void"), or the special version of [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") / [(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") II containing [(Dad's Note)](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note") [Dad's Note](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note"). No door outlines will appear at any boundary walls.
		- Additionally, this doesn't work during the [Red Redemption](/wiki/Red_Redemption "Red Redemption") challenge.
	+ The I AM ERROR room door can only be created while already inside a Red Room. Normal rooms will not show the red outline if they are at the map's boundary.
* Red (Shop) [Shops](/wiki/Shop "Shop") will regularly not offer items from the [Shop item pool](/wiki/Shop_(Item_Pool) "Shop (Item Pool)") for sale, but instead draw from [Boss](/wiki/Boss_(Item_Pool) "Boss (Item Pool)") and [Treasure Room pools](/wiki/Treasure_Room_(Item_Pool) "Treasure Room (Item Pool)") instead. Additionally, Red Shops have a chance to become advanced Shops with many more items for sale, akin to  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper")'s better Shops.
* Red Key can't overwrite (Secret Room) [Secret Rooms](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") or (Super Secret Room) [Super Secret Rooms](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room"). This can be used to discern their locations by finding walls that don't have red door outlines that would otherwise be valid Red Room spots.
* Red Key can't create a room adjacent to the (Boss Room) [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_Room "Boss Room") on most floors, with some exceptions:
	+ Red Key can create a room adjacent to [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush")'s room in the top right where the room that leads to [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") usually generates. The door to this looks like a crack. This Red Room can only be created when Isaac is in another Red Room adjacent to it, i.e. from branching off one of the (Treasure Room) [Treasure Rooms](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room").
		- Isaac can enter Hush's room from this crack, but going the other direction will lead him to the Entrance Portal room.
		- Strangely, Isaac also can't create Red Rooms adjacent to the (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop") on this floor either.
	+ Red Key can create rooms adjacent to most Boss Rooms in [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void"), including [Delirium](/wiki/Delirium "Delirium")'s room. This can be used to find a Boss Room door leading to what would be an empty space (though this may find [Mr. Fred](/wiki/Mr._Fred "Mr. Fred") instead).
	+ Red Key can create rooms adjacent to the (Boss Room) [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_Room "Boss Room") in the [Mirrored World](/wiki/Mirrored_World "Mirrored World") of [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") / [(Dross)](/wiki/Dross "Dross") [Dross](/wiki/Dross "Dross") II.
* When Isaac enters any Red Room adjacent to the (Ultra Secret Room) [Ultra Secret Room](/wiki/Ultra_Secret_Room "Ultra Secret Room"), it immediately appears on the map along with the Secret Room jingle, and its door will automatically open.
* If Isaac encounters a Red [special room](/wiki/Special_room "Special room"), all of its doors will be its special theme doors.
	+ All doors in a Red (Curse Room) [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") still feature spikes, which will damage Isaac if he decides to enter/exit.
	+ A Red (Vault) [Vault](/wiki/Vault "Vault")'s doors or a Red (Dice Room) [Dice Room](/wiki/Dice_Room "Dice Room")'s doors each require two keys to open. The door where Isaac uses Red Key will be automatically unlocked, but the other doors remain locked until Isaac goes through them from inside or unlocks them from outside.
* Multiple Red special rooms of the same type can spawn on one floor.
* All Red (Sacrifice Room) [Sacrifice Rooms](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room") will have their own independent use counters and rewards.
* If Isaac has a teleport to a specific room ([(XVII - The Stars)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XVII - The Stars") [XVII - The Stars](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), [(IX - The Hermit)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "IX - The Hermit") [IX - The Hermit](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), [(Teleport 2.0)](/wiki/Teleport_2.0 "Teleport 2.0") [Teleport 2.0](/wiki/Teleport_2.0 "Teleport 2.0"), etc.) and has created a special room such that there are multiple of a certain type on one floor, the teleport will choose randomly between each room.
	+ However, if Isaac has found a Red (Planetarium) [Planetarium](/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium"), XVII - The Stars will always teleport Isaac to it over any (Treasure Room) [Treasure Rooms](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room").
* It is possible to obtain [(Knife Piece 1)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") [Knife Piece 1](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") and [(Knife Piece 2)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") outside of the intended methods by spawning Treasure Rooms that contain them.[*[citationÂ needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citation_needed "wikipedia:citation needed")*]
* In [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") / [(Dross)](/wiki/Dross "Dross") [Dross](/wiki/Dross "Dross") II, if Isaac enters a Red Room after touching the [White Fire Place](/wiki/White_Fire_Place "White Fire Place") and becoming  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"), he will still be The Lost in every Red Room, but will change back to his regular form when entering a normal room.
	+ Red Rooms in Downpour/Dross can contain White Fire Places as well.
* Isaac is able to create Red Rooms in the [Mirrored World](/wiki/Mirrored_World "Mirrored World") of [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") / [(Dross)](/wiki/Dross "Dross") [Dross](/wiki/Dross "Dross") II. They will be reflections of the original floor's Red Rooms, and special rooms created in this way will still be empty.
* Red Rooms can't be created around the (Mine Cart Room) [Mine Cart Room](/wiki/Mine_Cart_Room "Mine Cart Room") of [(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines") / [(Ashpit)](/wiki/Ashpit "Ashpit") [Ashpit](/wiki/Ashpit "Ashpit") II.
	+ Red Rooms on these floors can contain the yellow buttons used to build the mine cart track, however these ones do nothing.
* Red Rooms in [Chapter 3](/wiki/Chapter_3 "Chapter 3") can contain [Marked Skulls](/wiki/Rocks#Marked_Skulls "Rocks") even before the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent") is unlocked.
* When in [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") or [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)"), their spawn room containing their respective chests can be created by Red Key. These will function as regular chests of their respective type.
	+ New [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") doors can't be found in these rooms.

Interactions[]
--------------


* [(4.5 Volt)](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") [4.5 Volt](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt"): Usually generates fewer than 1 charge per room, as Red Rooms are always 1x1.
