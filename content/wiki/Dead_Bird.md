Effects[]
---------


* Holding the active item button will gradually deplete the charge bar. As the charge gets closer to zero, Isaac turns bluer over time.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) Once the invincibility takes effect, Isaac starts flashing rapidly.
* Gives a brief moment of invincibility when the charge bar hits zero. If the spacebar is held for an additional second after hitting zero, Isaac will take damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) While Isaac is invincible, he deals 3.5 contact damage to enemies and beams of light will strike down enemies touching Isaac, similar to (Added in Afterbirth)[(Holy Light)](/wiki/Holy_Light "Holy Light") [Holy Light](/wiki/Holy_Light "Holy Light"), dealing 15 damage.
		- While not time based, invincibility from Breath of Life is otherwise identical to damage immunity granted by the [shield](/wiki/Temporary_Buffs "Temporary Buffs") effect.
* The item will recharge on its own but cannot be used again until it is fully charged (even if you didn't fully deplete the charge bar).


Synergies[]
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Creates a wisp after it's been held long enough for Isaac to take damage.
* (Removed in Repentance)[(Isaac's Heart)](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Heart "Isaac's Heart") [Isaac's Heart](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Heart "Isaac's Heart"): When held down too long, Breath of Life no longer damages Isaac, resulting in infinite invincibility.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Void)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): Using Void with Breath of Life will immediately grant invincibility frames.
