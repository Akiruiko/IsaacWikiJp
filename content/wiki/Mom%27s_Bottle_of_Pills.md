Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns wisps in the inner ring, looking like pills. The wisps spawn [pills](/wiki/Pill "Pill") when destroyed. The wisps come in random colors (Blue, Red, White, Pink, Gray, Light Blue, and Yellow). Each color may fire tears that confuse, poison, petrify, burn, or spawn troll bombs. Each tear effect is assigned to one color of pill wisp based on the current seed. The only color pill wisp without a tear effect also spawns a hostile [Spider](/wiki/Spider "Spider") when destroyed. For the troll bomb effect, the pill itself spawns the troll bomb instead of the tear, and the chance for it to do so is independent of whether or not its tears hit anything.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Starter_Deck.png)](/wiki/Starter_Deck "Starter Deck") [Starter Deck](/wiki/Starter_Deck "Starter Deck"): Gives [cards](/wiki/Card "Card") instead.
