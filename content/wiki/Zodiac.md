Effects
---------


* Gives Isaac a [heart container](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health") and heals him for five hearts.
* Causes Isaac's bombs to leave a pool of [red creep](/wiki/Creep#Red_Creep "Creep") on the ground when they explode.
	+ The creep deals 2 damage per tick (20 per second) and lasts 15 seconds.
	+ Leaves one large creep in the middle, and four small creeps on random direction and distance.
		- Multiple creeps do not inflict damage on an enemy simultaneously.
* If Isaac has no bombs, allows him to place a bomb at the cost of taking half a heart of damage. This prioritizes red hearts over soul hearts.


Notes
-------


* Placing a bomb using health counts as self-damage, and as such, does not affect the chances for a [Devil deal](/wiki/Devil_deal "Devil deal"), does not trigger [![image](/image/Damocles.png)](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles") [Damocles](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles"), nor does it reroll  [(Tainted Eden)](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden") [Tainted Eden](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden").
	+ [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") /  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") will die if a bomb is placed this way.
* [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") /  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") will take 1 [Coin Heart](/wiki/Coin_Heart "Coin Heart") of damage in exchange for 1 bomb.
* Placing a bomb which costs half a heart of damage will prioritize red hearts first.
	+ Therefore, you can remain at zero bombs and leave excess drops of bombs and hearts to maximize your resource use for the floor.
	+ This mechanic can be used to enter a Curse room without taking blue/black heart damage.
		- But be careful and remember to move quickly upon exiting the Curse room if you used this mechanic to enter, otherwise you'll take the explosion damage.
