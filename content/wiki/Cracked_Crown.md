 # Cracked Crown ![image](/image/Cracked_Crown.png) 

Effects
---------


* (Removed in Repentance) -20% [tear delay](/wiki/Tear_delay "Tear delay") (increased rate of fire)
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Since this directly affects tear delay instead of changing the tears stat, it allows Isaac's rate of fire to go over the normal maximum rate.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Tear delay decreases are more noticeable and are a greater increase to DPS when the tears stat is high.
* Boosts [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed"), [range](/wiki/Range "Range"), [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed"), [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears") and [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") if they are above their base values.
	+ Affects stat bonuses from passive items, trinkets that are absorbed or in a second trinket slot, and permanent bonuses given by items such as [(Void)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void").
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The extra stat upgrades are approximately 33% of the original.
		- (Added in Repentance) The extra stat upgrades are approximately 20% of the original.


Notes
-------


* The trinket does nothing for the listed boostable stats if they are at or below the base value; the boost is calculated on the *total* bonus, not per item.
* [Luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck") is not affected by Cracked Crown.
* (Added in Repentance) For [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") upgrades, the 20% bonus is given to the change to Isaac's actual damage, not the damage upgrade itself.
* (Added in Repentance) For [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears") upgrades, the 20% bonus is given to the change to Isaac's tears fired per second, not the tears upgrade itself. Items that boost tears fired per second directly are unaffected.
