Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Blank Card)](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") [Blank Card](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") / (Added in Repentance)[(Clear Rune)](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune") [Clear Rune](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune") / (Added in Repentance)[(Placebo)](/wiki/Placebo "Placebo") [Placebo](/wiki/Placebo "Placebo"): Because the active item is dropped upon usage, the recharge time for them is reset to 4, allowing to use more expensive cards/runes much more frequently.
