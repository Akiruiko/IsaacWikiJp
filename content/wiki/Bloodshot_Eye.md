 # Bloodshot Eye ![image](/image/Bloodshot_Eye.png) 

Effect
--------


* Summons an [orbital familiar](/wiki/Familiar#Orbital_Familiar "Familiar") eye. This eye shoots in the direction it faces at the time and does contact damage.
	+ The eye deals 2 contact damage per tick or 30 contact damage per second ((Added in Repentance) 20 damage per second) and its tears deal 3.5 damage. Tears are fired once every 2 seconds.
		- (Added in Repentance) The eye's only shoots tears when enemies are within its line of sight, and shoots once every 1/3rd of a second when it can.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Unlike other orbitals, the eye does not block enemy shots.


Notes
-------


* Caution is advised when placing [bombs](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb") with Bloodshot Eye, as the orbital's tears may knock the bomb elsewhere, (Removed in Repentance)and Bloodshot Eye will never stop shooting.
* (Removed in Repentance)It may not not always be a good idea to pick up Bloodshot Eye if Isaac has one or more [Pretty Flies](/wiki/Familiar#Pretty_Fly "Familiar") as orbitals, as Bloodshot Eye can override Pretty Flies without giving protection from enemy shots.
