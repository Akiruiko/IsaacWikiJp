 # Isaac's Head ![image](/image/Isaac%27s_Head.png) 

Effects
---------


* Isaac's severed head will follow him as a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") firing [piercing tears](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears") that deal 3.5 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") with each shot.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The head shoots once per second.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The head shoots once every 2/3rds of a second.


Notes
-------


* While holding this trinket, if there's another familiar that follows Isaac's Head, dropping this trinket will move the familiar to the first familiar slot.
	+ This resets upon quitting and re-entering the game.
	+ This is useful with familiars that are more effective when closer to Isaac, such as [(Lil Brimstone)](/wiki/Lil_Brimstone "Lil Brimstone") [Lil Brimstone](/wiki/Lil_Brimstone "Lil Brimstone") and (Added in Afterbirth)[(Incubus)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus").
