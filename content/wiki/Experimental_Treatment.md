 # Experimental Treatment ![image](/image/Experimental_Treatment.png) 


Effects
---------


* Tears have a 1/6 chance of spawning allied [Blue Flies](/wiki/Blue_Fly "Blue Fly") when they hit an enemy.
* This item belongs to the [Beelzebub](/wiki/Beelzebub "Beelzebub") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a giant humanoid fly.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Because the [Guppy](/wiki/Guppy "Guppy") transformation includes the guaranteed ability to spawn flies on hit, the Mulligan's effect is nullified. This means individual tears cannot spawn more than one fly per hit.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Guppy has been lowered to have a 50% chance of spawning a fly, allowing the 2 items to work together.
* (Removed in Repentance) This item does not work for  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") since the (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Incubus.png)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") tears do not count for her tears.
* Items and trinkets that increase tear firing rate synergize well with the Mulligan.
* This item is not affected by [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Constantly spawns blue flies when attacking.
* [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): The Mulligan's ability isn't affected by the charge time, meaning rapidly firing uncharged shots will generate a ton of blue flies.
* [![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") / [![image](/image/The_Parasite.png)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Has a 1/6 chance to spawn a fly on every hit by a split shot, which boosts the spawning of flies immensely.
* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[![image](/image/Finger!.png)](/wiki/Finger! "Finger!") [Finger!](/wiki/Finger! "Finger!"): Rapidly spawns blue flies when pointed at an enemy.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel"): Azazel's default brimstone spawns flies like regular tears.
* [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Overrides The Mulligan.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Flies only have a chance to spawn if the knife is stationary.
