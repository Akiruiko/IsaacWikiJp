 # Monkey Paw ![image](/image/Monkey_Paw.png) 

Effects
---------


* If Isaac has half a heart or less after taking damage, this trinket drops a [black heart](/wiki/Black_heart "Black heart").
* The effect can trigger up to three times, after which the trinket will disappear.
	+ The fingers stuck out by the paw will change to display the number of triggers left.


Notes
-------


* The effect can trigger more than once in the same room.
* If Gulped or smelted, its effect still only triggers 3 times, then disappears.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Golden Trinket)](/wiki/Golden_Trinket "Golden Trinket") [Golden Trinket](/wiki/Golden_Trinket "Golden Trinket") / (Added in Afterbirth)[(Mom's Box)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box") [Mom's Box](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box"): The trinket will drop 2 black hearts instead of 1 (having both Mom's Box and the golden version won't further increase the effect)
* [(Scapular)](/wiki/Scapular "Scapular") [Scapular](/wiki/Scapular "Scapular"): If the Scapular's effect is triggered, the [soul heart](/wiki/Soul_heart "Soul heart") awarded will not cancel the effect of Monkey Paw.
