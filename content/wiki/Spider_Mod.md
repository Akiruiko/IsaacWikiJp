 # Spider Mod ![image](/image/Spider_Mod.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns a grey spider [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that wanders around and allows Isaac to see tear damage and the health bars of all enemies.
	+ The spider will inflict a random [status effect](/wiki/Effects#Status_Effects "Effects") on any enemies it comes into contact with.
	+ The spider will sometimes drop a [Lil' Battery](/wiki/Little_Battery "Little Battery") or spawn a [Blue Spider](/wiki/Blue_Spider "Blue Spider") when a [room](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms") is completed.
* (Added in Afterbirth †) This item belongs to the [Spider Baby](/wiki/Spider_Baby_(Transformation) "Spider Baby (Transformation)") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a humanoid spider.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) For the sake of simplicity, all damage values shown are multiplied by 10 and rounded up to the nearest number.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Damage values are no longer multiplied or rounded.
* All stats effect damage dealt by Spider Mod is based on Isaac's damage stat.
* Spider Mod reveals [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan")'s health bar and is the only way to see his health.
	+ (Added in Repentance) In Repentance, doesn't reveal [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan")'s life bar during his second phase anymore.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Spider Mod also reveals the health bar for [Mother](/wiki/Mother "Mother"), the [Ultra Harbingers](/wiki/Harbingers_(Bosses)#Ultra_Harbingers "Harbingers (Bosses)"), and [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast").
* Spider Mod shows the health of invincible enemies, holes created by [Little Horn](/wiki/Little_Horn "Little Horn"), and the golden statue of [Ultra Greed](/wiki/Ultra_Greed "Ultra Greed").
* Spider Mod doesn't show if a segmented enemy has individual segment health like [Larry Jr.](/wiki/Larry_Jr. "Larry Jr.") or a health pool like [Chub](/wiki/Chub "Chub"). Against enemies with invulnerable segments such as [Carrion Queen](/wiki/Carrion_Queen "Carrion Queen") and [Scolex](/wiki/Scolex "Scolex"), its indicators will not differentiate between damage dealt to invulnerable and vulnerable segments.
* Spider Mod's damage doesn't account for enemy damage reduction or invulnerability, which means that the damage indicators for [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushroom_(Enemy) "Mushroom (Enemy)"), [Stone Grimaces](/wiki/Stone_Grimace "Stone Grimace"), and similar enemies will be inaccurate.
* (Added in Afterbirth †) If Isaac transforms into [Spider Baby](/wiki/Spider_Baby_(Transformation) "Spider Baby (Transformation)"), it spawns a spider familiar who works similarly to Spider Mod.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Makes Spider Mod bigger and increases the chance for Spider Mod to spawn a battery or blue spider. No effect on stat effect damage.
* [![image](/image/Hive_Mind.png)](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind") [Hive Mind](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind"): Makes Spider Mod bigger. Whether or not this impacts spawn chances or damage is unknown.
