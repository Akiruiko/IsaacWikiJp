 # Samson's Chains ![image](/image/Samson%27s_Chains.png) 

Effects
---------


* Attaches a ball and chain to Isaac's ankle that blocks projectiles and deals 5 damage per tick (~10.7 damage per second).
* If the ball is moving fast enough, it will destroy any [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles#Destructible "Obstacles") it comes into contact with (aside from Iron Blocks).


Notes
-------


* The item doesn't change the Speed [Attribute](/wiki/Attribute "Attribute"). Instead, whenever the chain is fully extended the ball will have to be dragged, which causes Isaac to slow down slightly.
* Cannot be used to open [Secret Rooms](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room") or [Super Secret Rooms](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room").


Synergies
-----------


* [Flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight"): Any method of flight makes it easier and quicker to use Samson's Chains to smash rocks, making for an efficient way to search for [Crawl Spaces](/wiki/Crawl_Space "Crawl Space").
