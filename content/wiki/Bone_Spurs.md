Effects[]
---------


* Upon entering a room, all enemies are [poisoned](/wiki/Status_Effects#Poison "Status Effects"), dealing double Isaac's [tear damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") and also creating a green fog for the first few seconds of the room.
* Killing enemies leaves a small, short-lasting pool of [green](/wiki/Creep#Green_Creep "Creep") [creep](/wiki/Creep "Creep") on the ground.
	+ The creep deals 1 damage per tick or 30 damage per second.


Notes[]
-------


* High tear damage will cause this item to become very powerful for rooms with a lot of enemies, since they can die instantly and render the room harmless.
* Enemies which spawn after the first few seconds of each room are not affected by this item, e.g. Flies spawned from a [Mulligan](/wiki/Mulligan "Mulligan") dying.
* Enemies that spawn with some form of invulnerability such as [Hosts](/wiki/Host "Host"), [Wizoobs](/wiki/Wizoob "Wizoob"), or (Added in Repentance) [Needles](/wiki/Needle "Needle") are not affected by this item.
* The poison effect only activates upon entering a room and not at the start of a wave. In [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") and most of [Greed mode](/wiki/Greed_mode "Greed mode"), the item will not poison enemies.
* If Toxic Shock is picked up in the middle of a room with enemies, the mass poison will occur immediately.
