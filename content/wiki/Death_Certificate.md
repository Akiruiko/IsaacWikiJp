 # Death Certificate ![image](/image/Death_Certificate.png) 

Effects
---------


* Takes Isaac to an abandoned and expanded version of [(Home)](/wiki/Home "Home") [Home](/wiki/Home "Home"), which has one copy of almost **every** item in the game. After taking an item, Isaac returns to the room he used Death Certificate in.
	+ There are also several [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") and [chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests") in the area. Picking them up/opening them will not cause Isaac to leave the area.
		- If a chest in the area contains an item, picking it up will cause Isaac to leave the area. This also applies to items created through use of pre-obtained items brought into the area, such as [![image](/image/Eden%27s_Soul.png)](/wiki/Eden%27s_Soul "Eden's Soul") [Eden's Soul](/wiki/Eden%27s_Soul "Eden's Soul") or [![image](/image/Mystery_Gift.png)](/wiki/Mystery_Gift "Mystery Gift") [Mystery Gift](/wiki/Mystery_Gift "Mystery Gift").


Notes
-------


* Items that have not been unlocked will not show up in this unique location.
* If Death Certificate is used on a floor while [(Curse of the Blind.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/f/f1/Curse_of_the_Blind.png/revision/latest?cb=20211023084947) [Curse of the Blind](/wiki/Curses "Curses") is active, the area will not be affected by the curse, meaning all items will be revealed.
* Items that are typically only granted under special circumstances like [![image](/image/Dogma_(Item).png)](/wiki/Dogma_(Item) "Dogma") [Dogma](/wiki/Dogma_(Item) "Dogma (Item)") and [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Shovel.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Shovel "Mom's Shovel") [Mom's Shovel](/wiki/Mom%27s_Shovel "Mom's Shovel") are present.
* The layout of the area is randomly generated, and items will show up in order of lowest ID number to highest (starting at items in the original *Flash* version and working up to the *Repentance* items).
	+ A new Death Certificate area is randomly generated on the next floor.
	+ If more items are added to the game through [modding](/wiki/Modding "Modding"), the area will expand to include them, ordered after the *Repentance* items.
* The only items that do not show up in the Death Certificate area are [![image](/image/Dad%27s_Note.png)](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note") [Dad's Note](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note"), hidden items ([![image](/image/Recall.png)](/wiki/Recall "Recall") [Recall](/wiki/Recall "Recall"), [![image](/image/Hold.png)](/wiki/Hold "Hold") [Hold](/wiki/Hold "Hold"), passive [![image](/image/Damocles.png)](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles") [Damocles](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles"), passive [![image](/image/The_Book_of_Belial.png)](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") [The Book of Belial](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial")), and Death Certificate itself.
	+ On challenges, several extra items will be missing. These include: [![image](/image/Ankh.png)](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") [Ankh](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh"), [![image](/image/Judas%27_Shadow.png)](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow") [Judas' Shadow](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow"), [![image](/image/Lazarus%27_Rags.png)](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags") [Lazarus' Rags](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags"), [![image](/image/Clicker.png)](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker") [Clicker](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker") and [![image](/image/R_Key.png)](/wiki/R_Key "R Key") [R Key](/wiki/R_Key "R Key").
		- On daily challenges, only Clicker and R Key will be missing.
* Using Death Certificate while in the area that generates from using it consumes the item without doing anything.
* Using this item multiple times in the same floor will always teleport to the same areas, without respawning the items that were taken or destroyed.
	+ If an item is taken, it will only destroy the other ones in the current room, meaning other items present in previous rooms will still be available.
	+ The player can be softlocked by using Death Certificate while having already taken/destroyed all items that were in the area.
* Using this item during the fight against [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") resets the fight after Isaac leaves the special area.
* If the item is used in a Devil Room or an Angel Room, Isaac will be teleported to the room Death Certificate was used in after taking a deal.


Synergies
-----------


* [(? Card)](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") [? Card](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card"): Mimics the effect of Death Certificate without consuming it.
* [![image](/image/Diplopia.png)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia"): Has no use inside of the Home area, as Isaac can only take 1 item. However, it can be used to duplicate the Death Certificate item, allowing Isaac to enter the area twice.
* [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"): Both characters can take an item from any given room if they're lined up correctly and take them at the same time.
* [![image](/image/Schoolbag.png)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"): Allows Isaac to hold another Active item into the area along with Death Certificate.
	+ [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void") / [![image](/image/Abyss.png)](/wiki/Abyss "Abyss") [Abyss](/wiki/Abyss "Abyss") / [(Black Rune)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Black Rune") [Black Rune](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Allows the consumption of items without forcing Isaac to leave the area.
	+ [![image](/image/Moving_Box.png)](/wiki/Moving_Box "Moving Box") [Moving Box](/wiki/Moving_Box "Moving Box"): Allows an additional 10 items to be taken without forcing Isaac to leave the area.
* [(Tainted Cain)](/wiki/Tainted_Cain "Tainted Cain") [Tainted Cain](/wiki/Tainted_Cain "Tainted Cain"): Unlike his modified pedestal behavior in the rest of the run, tainted Cain can pick up an item like normal in this area, effectively allowing him to craft any specific item for the cost of 8 bone hearts (the guaranteed recipe for death certificate in the bag of crafting). This can be a very easy way of acquiring any specific items or completion marks.
	+ The bag of craftingâ€™s set recipes do not require the death certificate to be unlocked, for consistent acquisition it is recommended to replace your active item in the secret room repeatedly to farm the bone hearts.
* [(Wild Card)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Wild Card") [Wild Card](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Will use Death Certificate if it was the item/card Isaac most recently used.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a single, regular wisp with no special properties.
* [![image](/image/Damocles.png)](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles") [Damocles](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles"): No effect; Damocles doesn't duplicate the item pedestals in any room.
* [![image](/image/Metronome.png)](/wiki/Metronome "Metronome") [Metronome](/wiki/Metronome "Metronome"): Can invoke the effect of Death Certificate as normal, even if it is not unlocked.
* [![image](/image/Red_Key.png)](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key") [Red Key](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key"): Using the Red Key in this area has a chance of spawning special rooms from Home. If Mom's bedroom is spawned and Isaac sleeps in the bed, the cutscene usually preceding the [Dogma](/wiki/Dogma "Dogma") fight will play, but nothing will change.
* [![image](/image/Sacred_Orb.png)](/wiki/Sacred_Orb "Sacred Orb") [Sacred Orb](/wiki/Sacred_Orb "Sacred Orb") / [(NO!)](/wiki/NO! "NO!") [NO!](/wiki/NO! "NO!") (doubled): The area will contain significantly fewer rooms and items to choose from, as they prevent items with low [quality](/wiki/Item_quality "Item quality") from appearing.
