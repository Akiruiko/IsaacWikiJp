 # Sack Head ![image](/image/Sack_Head.png) 

Effects
---------


* [Coins](/wiki/Coin "Coin") have a 10% chance to be replaced with [Grab Bags](/wiki/Grab_Bag "Grab Bag"). [Bombs](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb"), [Keys](/wiki/Key "Key"), [Cards](/wiki/Card "Card"), [Runes](/wiki/Rune "Rune"), and [Lil' Batteries](/wiki/Lil%27_Battery "Lil' Battery") have a 20% chance.
	+ This includes pickups spawned by most sources: room rewards, chests, slot machines, special shopkeepers, etc.
	+ Golden Coins can reappear as a sack when collected.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Coins bombed out of a [Donation Machine](/wiki/Donation_Machine "Donation Machine") can become sacks.
	+ The exception to this are pickups spawned by Isaac himself directly, e.g. with the likes of [![image](/image/IV_Bag.png)](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") [IV Bag](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") or [![image](/image/Fanny_Pack.png)](/wiki/Fanny_Pack "Fanny Pack") [Fanny Pack](/wiki/Fanny_Pack "Fanny Pack"), and contents of other sacks.
* Spawns a sack upon pickup.


Notes
-------


* The item does not replace hearts, pills and chests.
* The item can also replace Troll Bombs and Megatroll Bombs that are not used as attacks, i.e. generated as room rewards, chest contents and such.
* The pickup replacement is applied retroactively when the item is collected: any appropriate pickup already existing on the current level may be replaced by a sack.
* (Removed in Afterbirth †) Sacks on each floor tend to have the same contents, which can be taken advantage of if cards are involved.
* (Added in Repentance) Picking up a Golden Penny may spawn a sack instead of another Golden Penny.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Cracked Key)](/wiki/Cracked_Key "Cracked Key") [Cracked Key](/wiki/Cracked_Key "Cracked Key") in the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent") can be replaced by a sack, thus it is not recommended to take the item if you're going to unlock a tainted character.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Equality!)](/wiki/Equality! "Equality!") [Equality!](/wiki/Equality! "Equality!"): Sacks may drop new sacks while Equality! is active, potentially resulting in massive amounts of resources from a single sack.


* [![image](/image/Head_of_the_Keeper.png)](/wiki/Head_of_the_Keeper "Head of the Keeper") [Head of the Keeper](/wiki/Head_of_the_Keeper "Head of the Keeper"): Coins spawned from hitting enemies have a chance to become sacks.
