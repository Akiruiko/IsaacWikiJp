 # Proptosis ![image](/image/Proptosis.png) 

Effects
---------


* (Removed in Repentance) Doubles Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") stat.
* (Added in Repentance) +0.5 damage.
* Tear size multiplier: 2x.
* (Removed in Repentance) The tears shrink and lose damage the farther they travel.
* (Added in Repentance) The tears shrink and lose damage the more time they stay airborne, starting at 3x damage at point blank range. After 0.8 seconds, they deal no damage at all.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Effective range of Isaac's tears now also depends on the damage, as they can shrink out of existence before their air time runs out.
* (Added in Repentance) Since tears run out of damage after 0.8 seconds (48 frames), shot speed is the only stat that determines the effective range of Isaac's tears. Damage and range don't affect the travel distance at all.
* (Added in Repentance) Approximately 2.08% damage is lost per frame. This means at approximately 0.53 seconds (32 frames) Isaac's tears will deal the normal amount of damage.
* (Removed in Repentance) Tear size increasing items also increase the maximum distance before its disappearance, but the damage dealt can go below original at the extreme.
* The item has the opposite effect of the item [![image](/image/A_Lump_of_Coal.png)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal"), which makes Isaac deal more damage from farther away.
* (Removed in Repentance) Does not affect  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") short-ranged [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") unless the range stat is *extremely* high.
