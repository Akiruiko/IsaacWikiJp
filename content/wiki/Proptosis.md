Effects[]
---------


* Makes tears bounce off walls, [enemies](/wiki/Enemy "Enemy") and [environmental objects](/wiki/Obstacle "Obstacle").
	+ Tears that bounce off of enemies bounce in random directions, whereas tears that bounce off of walls and other objects bounce directly back.
	+ When tears bounce from enemies, they become able to hit the same enemy again should they bounce off of another enemy or obstacle.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) Tears bounce off bombs.


Synergies[]
-----------


* (Added in Afterbirth) [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): The blood laser bounces off of walls, creating a second beam that deals half damage.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth)  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel")'s Brimstone laser becomes a full length laser after bouncing, but will deal half of the damage.
		- (Added in Afterbirth †)  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel")'s Brimstone no longer becomes a full length laser after bouncing, and instead bounce as a regular mini-Brimstone.
* [(A Lump of Coal)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal"): Both effects stack, with tears that bounce off of enemies being able to hit others for more damage.
* [(The Parasite)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Tears will bounce off of walls without splitting, but split and bounce when hitting enemies. The split tears and the original one will bounce off everything.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Pop!)](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") [Pop!](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!"): Significantly increases the uptime of tears, since they are not limited by range and each tear will bounce off of each other. Continuously firing tears will eventually create a positive feedback loop, as the tears will keep bouncing faster and faster while not dropping to the floor.
	+ **Pop!** + [(A Lump of Coal)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal"): Extremely powerful combination; Lump of Coal's tear size increase will make it much easier for tears to bounce off of each other, while they increase in damage very rapidly. Given some time and enough tears, this can kill even final bosses such as [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush") and [Delirium](/wiki/Delirium "Delirium") quickly.
* (Added in Afterbirth) [(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology") / [(Technology 2)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") / [Tech.5](/wiki/Tech.5 "Tech.5"): Laser bounces off walls, creating a second beam that does half damage.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Tech X)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): The laser rings bounce off walls once.

* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Continuum)](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum") [Continuum](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum"): Overridden by Rubber Cement; tears will still bounce off of walls and obstacles.
* [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Overrides Rubber Cement.
* [(Epic Fetus)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Overrides Rubber Cement.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): No effect on the skeleton form's attacks.
* [Homing tears](/wiki/Homing_tears "Homing tears"): Tears will bounce off enemies and home back in, but to deal damage to that enemy again they must bounce off a different object.

* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Jacob's Ladder)](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder") [Jacob's Ladder](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder"): Tears don't generate arcs when hitting obstacles.
* [(Lost Contact)](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact") [Lost Contact](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact"): Tears will bounce off of enemy tears. **Not recommended** unless the player's fire rate is high, as it can prove detrimental when trying to hit a shooting enemy.
* [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Overrides Rubber Cement.
* [(Mom's Knife)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Overrides Rubber Cement.
* [Piercing tears](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears"): Tears that don't destroy enemies will bounce off of them instead of going straight through them. Tears can still damage enemies such as [Knights](/wiki/Knight "Knight") that are normally invulnerable from the front.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Sinus Infection)](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") [Sinus Infection](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection"): Boogers stick to enemies, but otherwise they bounce normally.
* [Spectral tears](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears"): Overridden by Rubber Cement.
