 # Lachryphagy ![image](/image/Lachryphagy.png) 


Effects
---------


* When used, destroys all [items](/wiki/Items "Items") on item pedestals in the room and gives Isaac a unique red locust [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") for each item destroyed.
	+ These locusts are permanent once created, up to a maximum of 64, after which creating more will replace older locusts.
		- This limit is shared with [blue flies](/wiki/Blue_fly "Blue fly") and [blue spiders](/wiki/Blue_spider "Blue spider").
	+ The locusts loosely follow Isaac similarly to regular blue flies, and charge in the direction Isaac is firing until they hit an enemy, a wall, or certain obstacles like key blocks, dealing Isaac's damage per tick (3 times per second).
	+ The locusts may gain additional effects depending on the item destroyed[[1]](#cite_note-1).


Notes
-------


* In rooms where there are multiple items to choose from, using Abyss will give only one locust for each item choice/set.
* If already at the maximum amount of locusts and presented with multiple non-choice item pedestals, using Abyss will only consume half of the pedestals.
* [(Tainted Apollyon)](/wiki/Tainted_Apollyon "Tainted Apollyon") [Tainted Apollyon](/wiki/Tainted_Apollyon "Tainted Apollyon") starts with this item in the consumable slot.
	+ If he dies and is revived as another character (e.g. through [![image](/image/Ankh.png)](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") [Ankh](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh")), that character will retain the locusts.
* If Abyss is used while Isaac is holding an item above his head, it can still consume the item and grant a locust.
* Using Abyss to destroy items in (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush") or (Challenge Room) [Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room") counts as taking the items and will cause waves of bosses or enemies to start spawning.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") / [![image](/image/Hive_Mind.png)](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind") [Hive Mind](/wiki/Hive_Mind "Hive Mind"): Increases the locusts' size and damage by 25%.
	+ These two items do not stack.
* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns wisps in the form of black-glowing flies with extra HP, that do not fire tears.
* [![image](/image/Death_Certificate.png)](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate") [Death Certificate](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate"): Abyss can be used to absorb items without being kicked out of the area, allowing Isaac to instantly gain max locusts if used in a large room with enough items.
* [(Extension Cord)](/wiki/Extension_Cord "Extension Cord") [Extension Cord](/wiki/Extension_Cord "Extension Cord"): Electricity will flow between Isaac and the locusts.


Interactions
--------------


* [(Baby-Bender)](/wiki/Baby-Bender "Baby-Bender") [Baby-Bender](/wiki/Baby-Bender "Baby-Bender") / [![image](/image/Box_of_Friends.png)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends"): Does not affect locusts.
* [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Locusts will only gain +2 damage.
* [![image](/image/Sacrificial_Altar.png)](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar") [Sacrificial Altar](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar"): Locusts can be sacrificed for items.
* [(Tainted Jacob)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") [Tainted Jacob](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") /  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus"): Locusts will disappear when changing between the 2 forms, and will not return when switching back.
* [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): If Void consumes Abyss, the latter will take priority and using Void to consume another item pedestal will generate a locust. Even consuming active items will generate a locust, and Void will not copy that active item's effect. This essentially causes Void to act identically to Abyss, albeit requiring 2 more charges per use.


Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | According to `locusts.xml`, [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") locusts are supposed to explode. This never happens in game; Ipecac only gives a locust that deals slightly more damage and poisons enemies.
