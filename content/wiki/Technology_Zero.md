 # Technology Zero ![image](/image/Technology_Zero.png) 

Effects
---------


* Connects tears with electricity that damages enemies.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The electricity's damage is equal to Isaac's [Damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
		- (Added in Repentance) The electricity deals 30% of Isaac's Damage, 15 times per second.
	+ A tear can generate one connection. The tear does not generate another connection even after the connection is lost. However, other tears can still make connections with it.
	+ Each of Isaac's tears can connect to other allied tears Including those of [shooting familiars](/wiki/Shooting_familiar "Shooting familiar").
		- The number of connections is limited by the number of Isaac's tears.

Interactions
--------------


* The following items override Technology Zero. Tears from other sources such as [![image](/image/Lead_Pencil.png)](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil") [Lead Pencil](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil") can still generate electricity with each other.
