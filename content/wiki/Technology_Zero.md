Effects
---------


* Connects tears with electricity that damages enemies.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The electricity's damage is equal to Isaac's damage.
		- (Added in Repentance) The electricity deals 30% of Isaac's damage.
	+ Each of Isaac's tears can connect to other allied tears Including those of [shooting familiars](/wiki/Shooting_familiar "Shooting familiar").
		- The number of connections is limited by the number of Isaac's tears.


Notes
-------

* [![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") / [![image](/image/Compound_Fracture.png)](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") [Compound Fracture](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") / [![image](/image/The_Parasite.png)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Split tears will be connected via electricity.
* [![image](/image/Evil_Eye.png)](/wiki/Evil_Eye "Evil Eye") [Evil Eye](/wiki/Evil_Eye "Evil Eye"): Tears fired by eye will be connected via electricity to Isaac's tears.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Eye_of_the_Occult.png)](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult") [Eye of the Occult](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult"): Allows you to move the electrified tears, allowing you to hit more enemies and do more damage.
* [![image](/image/Haemolacria.png)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): Main tears and bursts can be connected via electricity.
* [![image](/image/Jacob%27s_Ladder.png)](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder") [Jacob's Ladder](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder"): Both effects happening simultaneously creates lots of electricity.
* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Electricity connects the main tear to any other tears created by Isaac.
* [![image](/image/Pop!.png)](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") [Pop!](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!"): Tears in midair and tears that knock around each other will still be connected, effectively creating electric barriers.
* [![image](/image/Proptosis.png)](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") [Proptosis](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis"): Triples the electricity damage. Has no penalty with range.
* [![image](/image/Sinus_Infection.png)](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") [Sinus Infection](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection"): Boogers will have electricity flowing between them even if attached to the same enemy, dealing massive damage to bosses.

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Terra.png)](/wiki/Terra "Terra") [Terra](/wiki/Terra "Terra"): The lasers are capable of destroying terrain, but is unable to apply knockback, allowing to easily destroy large quantities of obstacles.
* [![image](/image/The_Wiz.png)](/wiki/The_Wiz "The Wiz") [The Wiz](/wiki/The_Wiz "The Wiz"): The diagonally-spreading tear shots will be connected by electricity, effectively making up for the item's blind spot and providing an attack with a very wide range.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Overrides Technology Zero.
* [![image](/image/Continuum.png)](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum") [Continuum](/wiki/Continuum "Continuum"): Tears will travel through walls; however, the electricity will not connect the tears while they are outside the room. Once tears have passed through walls, the electric arcs connect very erratically to other tears, limiting the efficiency of the combination.
* [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Overrides Technology Zero.
* [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Overrides Technology Zero.
* [![image](/image/Flat_Stone.png)](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone") [Flat Stone](/wiki/Flat_Stone "Flat Stone"): Only the last two tears will connect.
* [![image](/image/Haemolacria.png)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): Overrides Technology Zero.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Overrides Technology Zero.
* [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"): Overrides Technology Zero.
* [![image](/image/Tech_X.png)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): Overrides Technology Zero.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Trisagion.png)](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion") [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion"): Overrides Technology Zero.
	+ (Added in Repentance) **Sometimes** overrides Technology Zero. Will occasionally cause the game to crash, if combined with additional tear increases. Firing for prolonged periods of time in a room will eventually cause Technology Zero to trigger.
