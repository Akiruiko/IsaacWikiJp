Effects
---------


* Firing without a pause for 7.5 seconds creates a small brown cloud that damages enemies who walk through it.
	+ The damage is equal to Isaac's base tear damage, dealt roughly 5 times per second.
	+ The clouds can be moved by shooting them.
	+ The clouds only last for 15 seconds, meaning a maximum of two can be active at any given time.
	+ Changing firing direction is allowed, but any pause in holding a fire button or taking damage resets the timer.
