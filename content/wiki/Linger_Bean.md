 # Linger Bean ![image](/image/Linger_Bean.png) 


Effects
---------


* On use, takes a full red heart of [health](/wiki/Health "Health") and grants +1.2 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") for the current [room](/wiki/Room "Room").


Notes
-------


* (Added in Afterbirth)  [(Eve)](/wiki/Eve "Eve") [Eve](/wiki/Eve "Eve") starts with this item after unlocking it and donating 439 [coins](/wiki/Coins "Coins") to the [Greed Machine](/wiki/Greed_Machine "Greed Machine").
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Both conditions must be met for Eve to hold it; donating 439 coins before defeating [Satan](/wiki/Satan "Satan") with Eve will wrongly state on Eve's profile on the Character Selection Screen that she has it equipped.
		- (Added in Repentance) Eve now starts with the Razor Blade if unlocked from the Greed Machine, even if Satan has not been defeated with Eve.
* If Isaac doesn't have a full Red Heart or a filled [Bone Heart](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart"), then [Soul](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart"), [Black](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart"), and empty Bone Hearts are taken instead.
* The effect stacks with itself and [(Red Patch)](/wiki/Red_Patch "Red Patch") [Red Patch](/wiki/Red_Patch "Red Patch"), which provides a similar benefit.
* Using this item does not affect [Devil or Angel room](/wiki/Devil_deal "Devil deal") chances.
* Using this item as  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") will result in death.
* When picked up, Isaac's tears turn red, though this change is purely cosmetic.
* The Razor Blade prioritizes Red Hearts first.
	+ Using the Razor blade grants Isaac the regular immunity frames upon usage; this allows Isaac to enter cursed rooms without using soul hearts should he have them.
* Using this item in the [Greed mode](/wiki/Greed_mode "Greed mode") [Ultra Greed](/wiki/Ultra_Greed "Ultra Greed") boss room will result in Isaac losing 2-4 coins and dropping 1-3 pennies on the floor similar to being hit by any of the greed enemies.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns red wisps in the middle ring. Wisps have higher health.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Isaac%27s_Heart.png)](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Heart "Isaac's Heart") [Isaac's Heart](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Heart "Isaac's Heart"): Isaac cannot take damage from the Razor Blade, allowing for infinite uses of the item.
* [![image](/image/Old_Bandage.png)](/wiki/Old_Bandage "Old Bandage") [Old Bandage](/wiki/Old_Bandage "Old Bandage") / (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[![image](/image/Shard_of_Glass.png)](/wiki/Shard_of_Glass "Shard of Glass") [Shard of Glass](/wiki/Shard_of_Glass "Shard of Glass"): Isaac has a chance to drop a red heart while using the item.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Panic Button)](/wiki/Panic_Button "Panic Button") [Panic Button](/wiki/Panic_Button "Panic Button"): Self-damage occurs before enemy damage, making it almost impossible to lose Angel or Devil chance.
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid"): Isaac takes no damage while invincible, allowing for repeated free uses of the item.
* [![image](/image/The_Wafer.png)](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer") [The Wafer](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer"): Isaac loses half a heart instead of a full heart.
* [![image](/image/Whore_of_Babylon.png)](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") [Whore of Babylon](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon"): The Razor Blade can be used to activate this item's effect by doing enough damage to get Isaac down to half a red heart (or one red heart as Eve), providing a big damage boost for the current room at the cost of health.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") & [(Judas)](/wiki/Judas "Judas") [Judas](/wiki/Judas "Judas"): Actives the effect of [![image](/image/Blood_Rights.png)](/wiki/Blood_Rights "Blood Rights") [Blood Rights](/wiki/Blood_Rights "Blood Rights") alongside it's normal effect.

* (Added in Repentance) [Shield](/wiki/Shield "Shield")/[Invulnerability](/wiki/Invulnerability "Invulnerability"): Will not protect against this item's damage.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Tainted Samson)](/wiki/Tainted_Samson "Tainted Samson") [Tainted Samson](/wiki/Tainted_Samson "Tainted Samson"): Using this item can make Tainted Samson unkillable, as his Berserk timer gains time when damaged, and he can't die from lack of red hearts during the rage.


Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | As Eve, there is a very unlikely chance that using this to activate Whore of Babylon will not activate it, despite being at the correct health to do so.
