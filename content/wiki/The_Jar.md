Effects[]
---------


* Copies the effects of Isaac's held [rune](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Runes "Cards and Runes") or [soul stone](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Soul_Stones "Cards and Runes"), similar to the [(Blank Card)](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") [Blank Card](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") and [(Placebo)](/wiki/Placebo "Placebo") [Placebo](/wiki/Placebo "Placebo").
* Drops one random rune the first time it's picked up.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns purple-glowing rune wisps on the middle ring. The wisps spawn [Runes/Soul Stones](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Runes "Cards and Runes") when destroyed, and enemies killed by the wisps' tears have a 15% chance to drop a Rune/Soul Stone. The effect of the wisps and the types of runes they spawn are independent from Clear Rune's charge time and the most recently used rune.
* [(Butter!)](/wiki/Butter! "Butter!") [Butter!](/wiki/Butter! "Butter!"): Because Clear Rune is dropped upon usage, the recharge time for them is reset to 4, allowing to use more expensive runes much more frequently.
* [(Car Battery)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Essentially uses the rune or soul stone twice.
* [(Rune of Jera)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Jera") [Rune of Jera](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Allows Isaac to copy pickups with every use. This combination can double [Lil' Batteries](/wiki/Lil%27_Battery "Lil' Battery"), which can both circumvent the rune's high charge time and allow for game-breaking combos with repeated use of the synergy.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Tarot Cloth)](/wiki/Tarot_Cloth "Tarot Cloth") [Tarot Cloth](/wiki/Tarot_Cloth "Tarot Cloth"): No effect.
* [(Void)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void"): If Void absorbs both Clear Rune and a consumable-producing item like [(Mom's Bottle of Pills)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Bottle_of_Pills "Mom's Bottle of Pills") [Mom's Bottle of Pills](/wiki/Mom%27s_Bottle_of_Pills "Mom's Bottle of Pills") the latter takes effect first, shifting any rune you are holding out of the primary consumable slot and rendering the Clear Rune effect useless.
