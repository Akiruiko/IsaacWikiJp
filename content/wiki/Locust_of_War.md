 # Locust of War ![image](/image/Locust_of_War.png) 

Effects
---------


* Upon entering a room with enemies for the first time, spawns a [Red Locust](/wiki/Familiars#Locusts "Familiars") which detonates upon impact with enemies, dealing double tear damage for the impact of the Locust and 60 damage for the explosion.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) This trinket can be dangerous to hold, as the locust will instantly target the nearest enemy as Isaac enters the room, which can be close enough to catch Isaac in its blast radius.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The explosion from the locust is very small, on scale of a single tile, but can still hurt Isaac.
* The Locust will also spawn each time a wave starts in (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush").
* The explosion takes most bomb effects from items that Isaac has, with some exceptions.
