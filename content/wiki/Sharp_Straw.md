Effects[]
---------


* Damages all enemies in the room.
	+ The damage dealt is equal to Isaac's current [tear damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") plus 10% of the enemy's max health.
* Has a 15% chance to drop [half red hearts](/wiki/Hearts#Half_Red_Heart "Hearts") when it damages an enemy.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) May also drop [half soul hearts](/wiki/Hearts#Half_Soul_Heart "Hearts"). Half red hearts will always drop when the player has at least one red heart container; otherwise, half soul hearts will drop.
	+ The amount of enemies damaged does not improve the chance.


Notes[]
-------


* When used on [Delirium](/wiki/Delirium "Delirium"), this item should be used when it isn't transformed to deal the most damage, as Delirium doesn't have his [armor](/wiki/Damage_Scaling "Damage Scaling") up when in his true form.
* For enemies that can disappear or go underground, it only affects them if they are visible.


Synergies[]
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Book of Virtues)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Enemies have a chance to spawn wisps when theyâ€™re killed by Sharp Straw. Using it in a room with no enemies does not grant a wisp. Despite Sharp Straw having a timed charge, the wisps persist between rooms.
* [(Car Battery)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Damage is doubled and two half hearts may be dropped.


Interactions[]
--------------


* (Added in Repentance) [(Ipecac)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Only provides a +2 damage bonus instead of +40.
