Effects[]
---------


* (Removed in Repentance) Reduces [tear delay](/wiki/Tear_delay "Tear delay") by the formula: (delay / 4) - 2
* (Added in Repentance) Multiplies [fire rate](/wiki/Fire_rate "Fire rate") by 5.5x
* 0.2x [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") multiplier.
* (Removed in Repentance) 0.5x tear size multiplier.
* (Added in Repentance) Drastically reduces [knockback](/wiki/Knockback "Knockback") from Isaac's tears.
* (Added in Repentance) Automatically charges and fires tear-replacing charged attacks, such as [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"), [(Monstro's Lung)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"), and [(Chocolate Milk)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"), providing a different effect per item. Also removes the charge bar on them. See [Synergies](#Synergies).


Notes[]
-------


* At base tear rate, Soy Milk sets the player's tear delay to the game's minimum value of 1, for 15 tears per second. This is much lower than the normal minimum tear delay; see [the tear delay explanation page](/wiki/Tear_delay "Tear delay").
* (Removed in Repentance) At base damage, Soy Milk is a very small DPS up. With a tear delay of 8 or lower, Soy Milk becomes a DPS down. The more tears per second before obtaining Soy Milk, the greater the decrease in DPS.
* Soy Milk's damage down stat also significantly decreases tear size.
* The endless stream of tears effectively increases directional knockback.
* Due to the high fire rate, items that cause tears to inflict [status effects](/wiki/Status_effect "Status effect") activate more frequently.
* (Removed in Afterbirth) Soy Milk is a [special item](/wiki/Special_item "Special item").
* Charged items which do not affect tears such as (Added in Repentance) (Added in Afterbirth)[(Maw of the Void)](/wiki/Maw_of_the_Void "Maw of the Void") [Maw of the Void](/wiki/Maw_of_the_Void "Maw of the Void"), (Added in Repentance)[(Sumptorium)](/wiki/Sumptorium "Sumptorium") [Sumptorium](/wiki/Sumptorium "Sumptorium"), and (Added in Repentance)[(Revelation)](/wiki/Revelation "Revelation") [Revelation](/wiki/Revelation "Revelation") are not affected.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(20/20)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20"): The shot pattern may help in controlling enemy knockback, in addition to dealing up to double damage.
* [(Blood Clot)](/wiki/Blood_Clot "Blood Clot") [Blood Clot](/wiki/Blood_Clot "Blood Clot"): +1 damage bonus on Blood Clot tears is unaffected by the damage penalty.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone")/ [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel"): Beam can be fired continuously after charging.
* [(Chemical Peel)](/wiki/Chemical_Peel "Chemical Peel") [Chemical Peel](/wiki/Chemical_Peel "Chemical Peel"): +2 damage bonus on Chemical Peel tears is unaffected by the damage penalty.
* [(The Mulligan)](/wiki/The_Mulligan "The Mulligan") [The Mulligan](/wiki/The_Mulligan "The Mulligan"): Will generate an enormous wave of blue flies given that each tear has a 1/6 chance of spawning one.
* (Removed in Repentance)[(Chocolate Milk)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): Shots cannot be charged, but Isaac gains a flat +1 damage up after the Soy Milk penalty.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Shoots moderately charged shots at a quick pace. No longer gives +1 damage.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Cursed Eye)](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") [Cursed Eye](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye"): Fires automatically upon reaching full charge. This may be riskier than Cursed Eye alone because Soy Milk prevents you from holding a fully charged shot.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Explosivo)](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo") [Explosivo](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo"): Despite the tiny appearance of the bomb tears, the explosions will do normal explosion damage. Due to the massive fire rate, many bombs can be applied in extremely quick succession, decimating anything after a short delay.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Allows for incredibly fast firing medium damage bombs.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Fires tiny bombs, like the kinds created by [Scatter Bombs](/wiki/Scatter_Bombs "Scatter Bombs"). Damage downgrade applies as normal.
* [(Ipecac)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): The very fast rate of fire fills the screen with low damage explosions.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Libra)](/wiki/Libra "Libra") [Libra](/wiki/Libra "Libra"): Decreases fire rate slightly, but massively increases damage, range, and speed. Tear height is also massively increased, meaning tears can hit enemies through obstacles without spectral effect.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Resets stats to slightly higher than base level.
	+ (Added in Repentance) **Libra** + [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Constant Brimstone beam at with normal/higher damage.
* [(Lost Contact)](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact") [Lost Contact](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact"): Extremely effective at blocking shots.
* [(A Lump of Coal)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal"): Significantly increases tear damage as they get further away. Even with only this synergy, individual tear damage appears to approach starting tear damage when firing over longer distances.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Monstro's Lung)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"): Automatically charges and fires tear barrages.
* [(Mysterious Liquid)](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid") [Mysterious Liquid](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid"): Each shot creates creep that deals reasonable damage but stacks with every shot, causing hefty damage.
* [Piercing tears](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears"): Causes tears to affect enemy movement less for better accuracy, though also removes the advantage of rapidly knocking back enemies.
* [(Pisces)](/wiki/Pisces "Pisces") [Pisces](/wiki/Pisces "Pisces"): Greatly increases knockback, allowing tears to pin enemies against walls.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Rock Bottom)](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom") [Rock Bottom](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom"): If Soy Milk is picked up at an opportune time (after Rock Bottom and preferably near the end of the run), it will result in a huge gain in fire rate without the damage penalty.
* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[(Technology Zero)](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero") [Technology Zero](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero"): The near-constant stream of tears will have electricity chained between them, providing an electrical net of damage making it almost impossible to not hit an enemy. This can greatly help offset the lowered damage by increasing the number of hits.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Tech X)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): Automatically charges and fires fully charged Tech X rings. Non-fully charged rings can still be fired by releasing the fire key during charging, but much harder due to the high fire rate and removal of charge bar.


Interactions[]
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Almond Milk)](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk") [Almond Milk](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk"): Overrides Soy Milk (no additional effect on tears or damage).
* [(Epic Fetus)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Damage of missiles will be decreased accordingly, but unlike normal tears, there is still a fixed timed delay between firing missiles.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Kidney Stone)](/wiki/Kidney_Stone "Kidney Stone") [Kidney Stone](/wiki/Kidney_Stone "Kidney Stone")'s charge time is not affected.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Mom's Knife)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") No special synergy. Charge bar still disappears, but knife will not be automatically released upon full charge.
* (Removed in Repentance)[(Proptosis)](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") [Proptosis](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis"): The low-damage, lowered size tears disappear extremely quickly, greatly reducing range.
	+ (Added in Repentance)Tears no longer dissappear instantly. Range is slightly shorter.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Technology 2)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2"): Half of the Soy Milk tears are replaced by a constant laser, but damage down compounds.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Half of the Soy Milk tears are replaced by a constant laser and there is no further damage down on it.
