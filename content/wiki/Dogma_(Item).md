Effects
---------


* Grants flight.
* Grants a one-time [![image](/image/Holy_Mantle.png)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle")-like effect. This effect wears off upon leaving the room.
* +0.1 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed").
* +2 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
* If Isaac has fewer than 6 full [hearts](/wiki/Health "Health") of health, Isaac is given enough hearts to get to six full hearts, first by restoring empty red heart containers, and then by granting soul hearts if that isn't enough.
	+ Does not affect  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") or  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") normally.
	+ [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper")'s coin heart containers are affected by the red heart healing, but they will gain [Blue Flies](/wiki/Blue_Fly "Blue Fly") instead of soul hearts.
	+ [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") will have all his bone hearts replenished, and any soul hearts earned will go to The Soul.
	+ [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") will gain soul charges instead of soul hearts.
	+ [![image](/image/Alabaster_Box.png)](/wiki/Alabaster_Box "Alabaster Box") [Alabaster Box](/wiki/Alabaster_Box "Alabaster Box") will take the soul hearts before they're given to Isaac, like normal.
* On Normal mode, grants [![image](/image/The_Wafer.png)](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer") [The Wafer](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer") effect, reducing all damage taken to half a heart.


Notes
-------


* As with all items crucial to story progress ([![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid"), [![image](/image/The_Negative.png)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative"), [![image](/image/Key_Piece_1.png)](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1") [Key Piece 1](/wiki/Key_Piece_1 "Key Piece 1"), [![image](/image/Key_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Key_Piece_2 "Key Piece 2") [Key Piece 2](/wiki/Key_Piece_2 "Key Piece 2"), [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_1.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1") [Knife Piece 1](/wiki/Knife_Piece_1 "Knife Piece 1"), [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") and [![image](/image/Dad%27s_Note.png)](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note") [Dad's Note](/wiki/Dad%27s_Note "Dad's Note")), this item has protection from full-run rerolls.
	+ It also does not take up an item slot for  [(Tainted Isaac)](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac").
* Flight persists even while acquiring Knife Piece 2 (possible when carried over in a [RERUN](/wiki/RERUN "RERUN"), using [![image](/image/R_Key.png)](/wiki/R_Key "R Key") [R Key](/wiki/R_Key "R Key") or using [![image](/image/Spindown_Dice.png)](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") [Spindown Dice](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") on [![image](/image/Purgatory.png)](/wiki/Purgatory "Purgatory") [Purgatory](/wiki/Purgatory "Purgatory")), as story items' effects are not removed in that segment.
* Dogma's in-game appearance is actually TV static, much like the boss, instead of being blue.
	+ This is because the blue is used to indicate areas that the game should apply the static effect to. This was likely done to avoid making the sprite file animated, instead simply letting the game apply the effect to designated areas when the time comes to use them.
* Dogma's Holy Mantle effect does not stack with an actual Holy Mantle, but it does stack with a [(Holy Card)](/wiki/Holy_Card "Holy Card") [Holy Card](/wiki/Holy_Card "Holy Card") effect.
