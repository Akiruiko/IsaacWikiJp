概要
-------


ノート
-------


* Resurrection items like [![image](/image/Dead_Cat.png)](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") [Dead Cat](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") are very valuable to The Lost because they are the only health ups you can get.
* Devil deals, while free, still count as making a deal with the devil and will prevent angel rooms from opening. Thus, a [(Credit Card)](/wiki/Credit_Card "Credit Card") [Credit Card](/wiki/Credit_Card "Credit Card") is still recommended, or getting (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Chaos.png)](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos") [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos") to acquire angel room items (except broken key pieces).
	+ (Added in Repentance) [(Credit Card)](/wiki/Credit_Card "Credit Card") [Credit Card](/wiki/Credit_Card "Credit Card") or (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Diplopia.png)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") are even more valuable, as Devil Deals are now choices.
* (Added in Afterbirth †) Isaac will be replaced by The Lost upon starting a third [victory lap](/wiki/Victory_lap "Victory lap"); however, Victory Laps do not allow the unlocking of achievements.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Since the Lost's Holy Mantle isn't intrinsic, the Victory Lap Lost will always die from one hit unless the player has explicitly found the Holy Mantle.
* (Removed in Afterbirth †) If The Lost's Holy Mantle effect is lost while within a [Curse room](/wiki/Curse_room "Curse room"), closing the game, starting it up and then continuing the run will restore the Holy Mantle's charge, allowing The Lost to leave the room unharmed.
* (Removed in Repentance) Using the D4 at all is not recommended as it will remove the Holy Mantle, making The Lost die in one hit.
* (Added in Repentance) The Lost's Holy Mantle effect is intrinsic to the character once unlocked, and it can't be rerolled.
* (Added in Repentance) The Lost starts with [![image](/image/Eternal_D6.png)](/wiki/Eternal_D6 "Eternal D6") [Eternal D6](/wiki/Eternal_D6 "Eternal D6"), even before it's unlocked.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Holy_Mantle.png)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") is intrinsic, but picking up another one does not double the effect.
	+ Being innate, this holy mantle effect is not shown in the HUD nor in the pause menu.
	+ It also cannot be re-rolled away.
		- Upon using the [![image](/image/D4.png)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4"), the holy mantle effect will be temporarily lost. Leaving the room will regenerate the shield. (possibly a bug)
* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance) After reaching [(Womb)](/wiki/Womb "Womb") [Womb](/wiki/Womb "Womb"), The Lost becomes slightly easier to play, because the invincibility frames from [![image](/image/Holy_Mantle.png)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") scale with the damage that would have been taken.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Holy Mantle breaking only grants one second of invincibility frames, regardless of the damage source.
* Using the [![image](/image/IV_Bag.png)](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") [IV Bag](/wiki/IV_Bag "IV Bag") will instantly kill  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") **The Lost** even with the Holy Mantle.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Using a [Blood Donation Machine](/wiki/Machines "Machines") will instantly kill  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") **The Lost** as well.

戦略
-------------------

Main article: [The Lost (Strategy)](/wiki/The_Lost_(Strategy) "The Lost (Strategy)")
* One of the biggest issues of having no health is that many items become completely useless: items that only give health ups, only become effective upon taking damage or cost health to use provide no benefit to The Lost.
	+ (Added in Repentance) This is alleviated by the (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Eternal_D6.png)](/wiki/Eternal_D6 "Eternal D6") [Eternal D6](/wiki/Eternal_D6 "Eternal D6") that The Lost starts with. Eternal D6 has a chance to destroy an item instead of rerolling it, which isn't bad if it's used on a useless item. In fact, on its own it can only yield a net positive (such as by rerolling a useless item into something useful) or neutral result, such as generating another useless item or destroying it.
* Trinkets and Items like (Added in Repentance)[(Brain Worm)](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm") [Brain Worm](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm") that can home-in and target enemies even at a distance are invaluable early game as you do not need to place yourself directly in the enemy's attack path and The Lost's spectral tears pass through most obstacles.


アイテム効果
-------------------

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright"): Prevents items with the internal tag `[nolostbr](/wiki/Item_Tags_nolostbr "Item Tags nolostbr")` from spawning. In practice, this automatically rerolls most items that aren't beneficial to The Lost, namely ones that only give health, flight, and/or spectral tears or activate upon taking damage.
* [![image](/image/Whore_of_Babylon.png)](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon") [Whore of Babylon](/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon "Whore of Babylon"): As the Lost has no health Whore of Babylon is constantly in effect, effectively changing into a damage and speed upgrade.


(Added in Afterbirth) Unlocking The Lost in Afterbirth
--------------------------------------------------------


The Lost is unlocked by dying in a [sacrifice room](/wiki/Sacrifice_room "Sacrifice room") while holding [(Missing Poster)](/wiki/Missing_Poster "Missing Poster") [Missing Poster](/wiki/Missing_Poster "Missing Poster"). 

* Looking for (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Mom%27s_Box.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box") [Mom's Box](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box") in shops makes finding the poster easier.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Glitter_Bombs.png)](/wiki/Glitter_Bombs "Glitter Bombs") [Glitter Bombs](/wiki/Glitter_Bombs "Glitter Bombs"), in conjunction with a large enough or infinite source of bombs (such as a [Gold Bomb](/wiki/Gold_Bomb "Gold Bomb")), have a small chance to drop trinkets, making it easier to find the poster.
	+ (Added in Repentance) This method got nerfed: (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Glitter_Bombs.png)](/wiki/Glitter_Bombs "Glitter Bombs") [Glitter Bombs](/wiki/Glitter_Bombs "Glitter Bombs") now have a cap on drops per floor.
* It is possible to unlock The Lost while holding [(Mysterious Paper)](/wiki/Mysterious_Paper "Mysterious Paper") [Mysterious Paper](/wiki/Mysterious_Paper "Mysterious Paper"), although the probability is small since it only has a 1/4 chance to imitate the [(Missing Poster)](/wiki/Missing_Poster "Missing Poster") [Missing Poster](/wiki/Missing_Poster "Missing Poster"). [![image](/image/Dead_Cat.png)](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") [Dead Cat](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") and other resurrection items could be useful for extra attempts.
* If Isaac happens to teleport away from the sacrifice room right as he dies, then he won't unlock The Lost.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Sacrificing health for the 12th time in a row and onwards has a 50% chance to teleport you to the [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room"). Make sure Isaac has no more than 11 hearts before attempting to die in the sacrifice room.


(Removed in Afterbirth) Unlocking The Lost in Rebirth
-------------------------------------------------------

The Lost is unlocked by dying 4 times in a row, each time with a certain character dying in a certain circumstance. Deaths **must** be completed consecutively in the order shown below.
Seeds can be used on all **but** the final step.

1. [(Isaac)](/wiki/Isaac "Isaac") [Isaac](/wiki/Isaac "Isaac") must die to a [Mulliboom](/wiki/Mulliboom "Mulliboom") in [Chapter 1](/wiki/Chapters "Chapters").
2. [(Magdalene)](/wiki/Magdalene "Magdalene") [Magdalene](/wiki/Magdalene "Magdalene") must die to her own [bomb](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb") in [Chapter 2](/wiki/Chapters "Chapters").
3. [(Judas)](/wiki/Judas "Judas") [Judas](/wiki/Judas "Judas") must die to [Mom](/wiki/Mom "Mom"). Being killed by any monster spawned by Mom will spoil the entire attempt at unlocking The Lost.
4. Finally,  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") must die to [Satan](/wiki/Satan "Satan"). Being killed by any of the other enemies spawned by Satan will spoil the entire attempt at unlocking The Lost. Using [![image](/image/The_Bible.png)](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") [The Bible](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") on Satan does not count as death from Satan.

The Lost will be unlocked after completing the steps shown above

#### Notes on unlocking The Lost


* Multiple lives (for example, obtained by [![image](/image/Dead_Cat.png)](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") [Dead Cat](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat")) must be depleted before the intended death, as deaths while having extra lives do not count as a game loss.
* Having any mods installed that triggers the mod flag will make The Lost unobtainable. To fix this problem, all mods have to be removed.
* The game cannot be won as any character required to unlock it when unlocking it.
* Champion versions of monsters and bosses will count for the death criteria.
* Runs can always be safely reset.
* Mom's Foot's stomp counts as explosive damage, which makes [![image](/image/Pyromaniac.png)](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") [Pyromaniac](/wiki/Pyromaniac "Pyromaniac") a problematic choice when trying to complete *Step 3*.
* Picking the wrong character while unlocking him doesn't mess up the unlocking process.
* Quitting and Restarting the game in the middle of the unlocking process doesn't mess it up.
* Picking up [![image](/image/Lazarus%27_Rags.png)](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags") [Lazarus' Rags](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags"), [![image](/image/Judas%27_Shadow.png)](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow") [Judas' Shadow](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow"), or [![image](/image/Ankh.png)](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") [Ankh](/wiki/Ankh "Ankh") should be avoided. These items will revive the current character as a different one and therefore prevent the current unlock-step from being fulfilled.
* Exploit: If you die during a required run, but hit the "start" button just as you die and reset before it shows [Isaac's Last Will](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Last_Will "Isaac's Last Will"), it will not count as a death that spoils the run, instead it counts as a restart.

### File Manipulation

By changing a file parameter, an unsuccessful try can be undone:



1. Backup the file `Options.ini` found in the `Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Rebirth` by making a copy of it in the same folder.

Open the original file with Notepad and change the `SteamCloud` parameter in it to `0`. This will disable Steam Cloud gamesaves synchronization.

1. After an unsuccessful try, delete the original file and rename the backup copy with the name of the original file: `Options.ini`
2. Repeat steps 1 after each successful run until you unlock The Lost.
3. When finished, open the original file and restore the `SteamCloud` parameter in it to `1`. This will enable Steam Cloud gamesaves synchronization again.


### Helpful Seeds For Rebirth

iOS E1NZ N3MA (bomb in second floor shop, the fires should give enough pennies to buy the bomb.)

Judas
PC YR8E YXDV (Must be on Normal difficulty. Polyphemus in the first Treasure Room. Do not take devil deals, as Trinity Shield and Sacred Heart will be available in Angel Rooms. Keep the Book of Belial to ensure they show up. Also, from the pills from Mom's Coin Purse (1st boss, Duke of Flies), take the orange (Health Up) then the white one (Full Health), ignore the blue ones (Speed Down)).
PC N0G3 VLD4 (Both modes) - Dr. Fetus on floor 1, and Ipecac on floor 2.
PS4 DMTM NRD9 (Do not make a Devil Room deal in Basement II will spawn an Angel Room with Holy Grail in Caves I. Collecting everything grant huge tears.
3DS 180Y 7RDC (Lots of health early (Rosary in first Treasure room), good pickups (Mulligan is in second Treasure room, Dr. Fetus and Mr. Mega in the third and fourth). Skip the first Devil deal, as the Angel deals are Sacred Heart, Mitre, and Scapular. Remember to trigger scapular before entering the Mom fight if you take it, as the immediate foot stomp may leave you with the bonus soul heart.)
iOS 0FP1 C9JK (The first boss room gives a heart, the first devil deal gives dead cat so you can survive.)

Azazel
Using a seed on this step will **not** count towards unlocking The Lost.
