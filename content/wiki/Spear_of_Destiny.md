* The item is similar to [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"), although it cannot be fired.
* (Removed in Repentance) Despite its size, the spear's hitbox is only located on the silver part and the handle, making it only effective at very close range.
