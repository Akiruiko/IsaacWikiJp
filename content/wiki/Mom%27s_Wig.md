Effects
---------


* Spawns a fly [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that orbits around a random enemy and deals 2 damage per tick/30 damage per second to enemies it comes in contact with.
	+ It will occasionally make a lunge towards the enemy it is orbiting, allowing brief contact even with smaller enemies.
	+ If the enemy it is orbiting dies, it starts orbiting a different enemy.
	+ If there are no enemies, it orbits Isaac.
* This item belongs to the [Beelzebub](/wiki/Beelzebub "Beelzebub") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a giant humanoid fly.


Notes
-------


* Angry Fly will orbit around invincible enemies such as [(Stone Grimace)](/wiki/Stone_Grimace "Stone Grimace") [Stone Grimaces](/wiki/Stone_Grimace "Stone Grimace") without dealing damage.
* Due to its movement pattern, its actual damage dealt per second is erratic against most enemies and groups of them.
* (Added in Repentance) As  [(Tainted Jacob)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") [Tainted Jacob](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob"), Angry Fly will orbit around [(Dark Esau)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob#Dark_Esau "Dark Esau") [Dark Esau](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob#Dark_Esau "Tainted Jacob").
