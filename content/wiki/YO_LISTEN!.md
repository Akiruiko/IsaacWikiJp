* (Added in Repentance) This item belongs to the [Beelzebub](/wiki/Beelzebub "Beelzebub") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a giant humanoid fly.


Notes[]
-------


* The familiar will sometimes hover over a pit, [poop](/wiki/Poops "Poops") or empty tile, indicating that an unreachable crawl space has been generated there.
	+ Although it might seem intuitive to dig the spot open with [(We Need to Go Deeper!)](/wiki/We_Need_to_Go_Deeper! "We Need to Go Deeper!") [We Need to Go Deeper!](/wiki/We_Need_to_Go_Deeper! "We Need to Go Deeper!") or [(Rune of Ehwaz)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Ehwaz") [Rune of Ehwaz](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), their chance of spawning a crawl space is independent and not guaranteed to work.
* An extra crawl space that is added by [(Stud Finder)](/wiki/Stud_Finder "Stud Finder") [Stud Finder](/wiki/Stud_Finder "Stud Finder") won't be identified by the familiar.
