 # SMB Super Fan ![image](/image/SMB_Super_Fan.png) 


Effects
---------


* On use, Isaac pulls out (or puts away) the urn; holding a fire button when it's pulled out emits a stream of blue flames in whichever direction Isaac is aiming. Each flame deals 22.5-31.5 damage per second, depending on how far it's traveled, plus an additional 4.5 damage per second times floor number. Multiple flames can damage the same enemy simultaneously.
	+ Isaac is also pushed backwards slightly while using it.
	+ The flames destroy enemy projectiles, poop, and other fires, but bounce off rocks.
* Killing enemies grants a soul charge to the Urn, up to a maximum of 20. Killing bosses grants a larger boost. Charges must be used to power Urn of Souls, with each charge being equivalent to 15 flames over the course of half a second.


Notes
-------


* Can be fired diagonally, or in any direction if using a gamepad or mouse controls (the latter being enabled in options.ini).
* The Urn can't be used to destroy [(Shopkeeper)](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper") [Shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper"), unlike [![image](/image/The_Candle.png)](/wiki/The_Candle "The Candle") [The Candle](/wiki/The_Candle "The Candle") and [![image](/image/Red_Candle.png)](/wiki/Red_Candle "Red Candle") [Red Candle](/wiki/Red_Candle "Red Candle").
* Multiple Urns share the same charges.
* [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") can use her soul charges to fuel the Urn. Likewise,  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") can use her blood charges.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Angelic_Prism.png)](/wiki/Angelic_Prism "Angelic Prism") [Angelic Prism](/wiki/Angelic_Prism "Angelic Prism"): Flames can be split into four multi-colored flames.
* [![image](/image/Bird%27s_Eye.png)](/wiki/Bird%27s_Eye "Bird's Eye") [Bird's Eye](/wiki/Bird%27s_Eye "Bird's Eye") / [![image](/image/Ghost_Pepper.png)](/wiki/Ghost_Pepper "Ghost Pepper") [Ghost Pepper](/wiki/Ghost_Pepper "Ghost Pepper"): The urn can emit flames from these items. Ghost Pepper flames are indistinguishable from Urn of Souls flames, but persist on the ground for longer.
* [![image](/image/The_Book_of_Belial.png)](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") [The Book of Belial](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") + [![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") as  [(Judas)](/wiki/Judas "Judas") [Judas](/wiki/Judas "Judas") /  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas"): The stream of fire is replaced with a controllable [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") beam that deals more damage the longer it's active. The damage ranges from 2.5 to 3.1 and scales with each floor, reaching a range of 5.4 - 6.7 on [Home](/wiki/Home "Home"). Souls dropped from enemies are colored red, and the Urn displays a red graphic on the HUD when active.
* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): A wisp spawns for every consecutive second Urn of Souls is fired. The occasional fires shot by the wisps block enemy shots, deal contact damage to enemies, and last for 3 seconds before dissipating. The flames deal 10 damage per tick for the first second they're out, scale down to 5 damage over the next second, and then stay at 5 damage until they dissipate (60-30 damage per second). The damage these fires deal does not increase with [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") or scale up on later floors.
* [![image](/image/Immaculate_Heart.png)](/wiki/Immaculate_Heart "Immaculate Heart") [Immaculate Heart](/wiki/Immaculate_Heart "Immaculate Heart"): Each individual flame has a chance to cause Immaculate Heart to generate an orbiting tear.
* [![image](/image/Lead_Pencil.png)](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil") [Lead Pencil](/wiki/Lead_Pencil "Lead Pencil"): Every 15 flames shot out of the urn will shoot a barrage of Isaac's tears.
* [![image](/image/Multidimensional_Baby.png)](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby"): All flames shot through Multidimensional Baby are doubled, providing a burst of flashing black-and-white tears.
