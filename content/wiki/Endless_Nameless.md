 # Endless Nameless ![image](/image/Endless_Nameless.png) 

Effect
--------


* When Isaac uses a [consumable item](/wiki/Item_slot "Item slot") like a pill or card, there is a 25% chance to spawn another copy of it.


Notes
-------


* Endless Nameless is especially useful when used with item multiplier [playing cards](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Playing_Cards "Cards and Runes").
* The new consumable will spawn before the effect goes through. This means teleportation will leave the new copy in the previous room, and item conversion or destruction cards like (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Ace of Diamonds)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Ace of Diamonds") [Ace of Diamonds](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") and (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Black Rune)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Black Rune") [Black Rune](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") will consume the new copy.


Synergies
-----------


* [Vurp!](/wiki/Pills "Pills") + [(D20)](/wiki/D20 "D20") [D20](/wiki/D20 "D20"): Consuming two Vurp! pills consecutively spawns an infinite amount of Vurp! pills, which can then be transformed with the D20.
* (Added in Repentance) [Golden Pills](/wiki/Pills "Pills"): A new golden pill may be spawned with each use, allowing for very easy exploitation. Works best with [(PHD)](/wiki/PHD "PHD") [PHD](/wiki/PHD "PHD")/[(Virgo)](/wiki/Virgo "Virgo") [Virgo](/wiki/Virgo "Virgo")/[(Lucky Foot)](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot") [Lucky Foot](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot"), to avoid potential stat downgrades.
