Effects
---------


* When using a [pill](/wiki/Pills "Pills"), [card](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Cards "Cards and Runes"), or [rune](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes#Runes "Cards and Runes"), Echo Chamber activates one of every pill type, card type, and rune type that has been previously used since obtaining Echo Chamber.


Notes
-------


* Previously used cards, pills, and runes are effectively used again, meaning items that modify the effects of cards, pills, or runes will also modify the effects that Echo Chamber activates.
	+ As a result, previously taken golden pills and blank runes will activate a random effect each time Echo Chamber activates them.
* Regardless of how many times a single type of card, pill, or rune has been used previously, it will only activate the effect once.
	+ Using items that convert pill effects into their good/bad counterparts such as [![image](/image/PHD.png)](/wiki/PHD "PHD") [PHD](/wiki/PHD "PHD") or [![image](/image/False_PHD.png)](/wiki/False_PHD "False PHD") [False PHD](/wiki/False_PHD "False PHD") can allow some pill effects to be activated twice by taking two different pills that activate the same effect.
* If Isaac uses cards that convert/destroy pickups (such as [(Ace of Spades)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Ace of Spades") [Ace of Spades](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), [(Black Rune)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Black Rune") [Black Rune](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), [(IX - The Hermit?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "IX - The Hermit?") [IX - The Hermit?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), etc.), any other cards Echo Chamber activates that generate pickups have a high chance to have their pickups converted.
* It is advised to avoid using cards that teleport Isaac, as he will be teleported to a specific room every time he uses a consumable. This effectively negates any current-room effects from consumables, such as [(XV - The Devil)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XV - The Devil") [XV - The Devil](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") or [(Rune of Algiz)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Algiz") [Rune of Algiz](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), as Isaac is teleported after they activate.
	+ Similarly, it is also advised to avoid using unidentified pills, as Isaac runs the risk of activating either a stat down or [Telepills](/wiki/Telepills "Telepills") every time he uses a consumable.
* When obtained on [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus"), Echo Chamber will only duplicate cards or pills previously used on the Lazarus state with Echo Chamber. As a result, teleport cards or Telepills can be freely used on the Lazarus state without Echo Chamber.
* If an item is somehow removed and reobtained during the run (such as when obtained from [![image](/image/Lemegeton.png)](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") [Lemegeton](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") or [(Modeling Clay)](/wiki/Modeling_Clay "Modeling Clay") [Modeling Clay](/wiki/Modeling_Clay "Modeling Clay")), all of the consumable types used during the time Isaac had Echo Chamber will be remembered.
	+ [![image](/image/Genesis.png)](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") [Genesis](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") and [Victory Laps](/wiki/Victory_Lap "Victory Lap") will erase all of the remembered consumable types, however.
* A card, rune, or pill must be **consumed** for the effect of Echo Chamber to trigger. That means using [![image](/image/Blank_Card.png)](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") [Blank Card](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card"), [![image](/image/Placebo.png)](/wiki/Placebo "Placebo") [Placebo](/wiki/Placebo "Placebo"), or [![image](/image/Clear_Rune.png)](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune") [Clear Rune](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune") will not trigger Echo Chamber.


Synergies
-----------


* [(? Card)](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") [? Card](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") + [(Ancient Recall)](/wiki/Ancient_Recall "Ancient Recall") [Ancient Recall](/wiki/Ancient_Recall "Ancient Recall") / [Vurp Pill](/wiki/Pills#Pill_Effects "Pills") + [![image](/image/R_Key.png)](/wiki/R_Key "R Key") [R Key](/wiki/R_Key "R Key"): TheÂ ? Card effect can be used in conjunction with R Key without consuming it, allowing the player to in theory (with the help of [![image](/image/Clicker.png)](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker") [Clicker](/wiki/Clicker "Clicker")) obtain completion marks for multiple routes and characters in a single run.
* [(Ancient Recall)](/wiki/Ancient_Recall "Ancient Recall") [Ancient Recall](/wiki/Ancient_Recall "Ancient Recall"): Can be used to spawn infinite cards.
* [![image](/image/False_PHD.png)](/wiki/False_PHD "False PHD") [False PHD](/wiki/False_PHD "False PHD"): Taking benign pills (e.g. puberty) will give black hearts or damage ups for each of the pills that are activated. Caution should be exercised when using this synergy, since all previously taken pills will be converted to their bad counterparts, and one stat down can ruin the synergy.
* [![image](/image/PHD.png)](/wiki/PHD "PHD") [PHD](/wiki/PHD "PHD"), [![image](/image/Virgo.png)](/wiki/Virgo "Virgo") [Virgo](/wiki/Virgo "Virgo"), or [![image](/image/Lucky_Foot.png)](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot") [Lucky Foot](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot"): All activated pills are converted to their good counterparts, including pills taken prior to picking up [![image](/image/PHD.png)](/wiki/PHD "PHD") [PHD](/wiki/PHD "PHD"), [![image](/image/Virgo.png)](/wiki/Virgo "Virgo") [Virgo](/wiki/Virgo "Virgo"), or [![image](/image/Lucky_Foot.png)](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot") [Lucky Foot](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot").
* [![image](/image/R_Key.png)](/wiki/R_Key "R Key") [R Key](/wiki/R_Key "R Key"): Using the R key does not reset the consumable pool, as such they stay the same in Echo Chamber too.
* [(Rune of Jera)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Jera") [Rune of Jera](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): Allows for infinite duplication of items and consumables.
* [![image](/image/Tarot_Cloth.png)](/wiki/Tarot_Cloth "Tarot Cloth") [Tarot Cloth](/wiki/Tarot_Cloth "Tarot Cloth"): Every activated tarot card will be given a bonus effect
* [Vurp Pill](/wiki/Pills#Pill_Effects "Pills"): Can be used to spawn infinite pills.
