Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Anti-Gravity)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): Placing many tears around Isaac creates a safe zone, especially with larger tears.
* [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone")/[(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology")/[(Technology 2)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2"): Beam/laser destroys projectiles, although only during its damage tick interval. The projectiles are not instantly destroyed when they touch the beam/laser.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Compound Fracture)](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") [Compound Fracture](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture")/[(Cricket's Body)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body")/[(The Parasite)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Split tears will be shielded. The Parasite's split tears will not appear to have shields.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Eye of Belial)](/wiki/Eye_of_Belial "Eye of Belial") [Eye of Belial](/wiki/Eye_of_Belial "Eye of Belial"): Piercing through a projectile will trigger Eye of Belial's double damage and homing effect. Belial tears will still block shots.
* (Added in Repentance) [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): Enemy shots may be reflected with melee attacks. The damage of the reflected shots depends on their size and properties, with standard enemy shots dealing 6 damage, champion and homing shots dealing 7 and explosive ones dealing 50.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Jacob's Ladder)](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder") [Jacob's Ladder](/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder "Jacob's Ladder"): Destroyed tears via shot-blocking will trigger the electric arc effect.
* [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Can block an infinite amount of enemy shots if the tear is placed on top of a monster. The projectiles that they attempt to shoot will be immediately destroyed.
* [(Mom's Knife)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): The knife will destroy projectiles in its path without being affected.
* [Piercing tears](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears"): The tears can pass through multiple enemy projectiles. This means that one tear can hurt the enemy and block its projectiles.
* [(Polyphemus)](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") [Polyphemus](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus"): Enemy shots are treated like enemies with 10 health, which are deducted from the Polyphemus tear. If it has strength remaining afterward, it will continue.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Sinus Infection)](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") [Sinus Infection](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection")/(Added in Repentance)[(Mucormycosis)](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis") [Mucormycosis](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis"): Tears that stick to enemies will block shots, and will not be destroyed in the process.
* [(Soy Milk)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): The constant stream of tears will cut through any complex attack patterns with ease.


* (Added in Repentance)[(Almond Milk)](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk") [Almond Milk](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk"): The random tear effects can allow more shots to be blocked, as effects such as (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Ouroboros Worm)](/wiki/Ouroboros_Worm "Ouroboros Worm") [Ouroboros Worm](/wiki/Ouroboros_Worm "Ouroboros Worm"), [(My Reflection)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection"), and [(Tiny Planet)](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") [Tiny Planet](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") can cause tears to wander outside of the main stream of tears. However, this, in combination with the lower fire rate of Almond Milk compared to Soy Milk, makes Almond Milk slightly less effective than Soy Milk at blocking shots in the direction Isaac is shooting.

* (Added in Afterbirth / Removed in Repentance)[(Tech X)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): The rings block enemy shots.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Trisagion)](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion") [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion"): Beams will block shots and continue on.
