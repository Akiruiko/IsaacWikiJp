Effects[]
---------


* Isaac's tears are now controlled mid-flight with tear controls instead of moving on their own, similarly to the controlled tear given by [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique").
* +1 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
* +7.5 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
* -0.16 [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed").
* This item belongs to the [Leviathan](/wiki/Leviathan "Leviathan") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into Leviathan.


Notes[]
-------


* The flight duration of tears is determined by the [range stat](/wiki/Range "Range").
* Items which use charge mechanics (like [(Chocolate Milk)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"), [(Cursed Eye)](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") [Cursed Eye](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") or [(Monstro's Lung)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung")) require precise input to be able to both charge the shot and then move the tears, making it significantly harder to control.
	+ Beams and lasers like [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") are unaffected by this.
* *MouseControl=1* enabled via the options.ini file does not allow the player to control the tears by mouse. Synergies which add a crosshair, however, will allow the tears to be controlled by mouse normally. (Further detail on valid synergies below)


Synergies[]
-----------


Synergies which cause auto-fire can have the firing stopped by pressing the "drop" key or button. Pressing Fire will resume auto-firing.



* [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Makes a purple homing beam. The brimstone laser is automatically fired at a controllable cross-hair target after pressing the fire key each room.
	+ [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel"): Like Brimstone, except that his short beam becomes a lasso. The loop starts where the beam would normally end and extends out to the cross-hair.
	+ [(Incubus)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus"): Will fire a straight laser towards the crosshair.
* [(Eye Sore)](/wiki/Eye_Sore "Eye Sore") [Eye Sore](/wiki/Eye_Sore "Eye Sore")/[(Loki's Horns)](/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns "Loki's Horns") [Loki's Horns](/wiki/Loki%27s_Horns "Loki's Horns")/[(Mom's Eye)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye") [Mom's Eye](/wiki/Mom%27s_Eye "Mom's Eye")/[(The Wiz)](/wiki/The_Wiz "The Wiz") [The Wiz](/wiki/The_Wiz "The Wiz") / [Conjoined](/wiki/Conjoined "Conjoined"): Extra tears fly in the same direction.
* [(Isaac's Tears)](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Tears "Isaac's Tears") [Isaac's Tears](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Tears "Isaac's Tears")/[(Tammy's Head)](/wiki/Tammy%27s_Head "Tammy's Head") [Tammy's Head](/wiki/Tammy%27s_Head "Tammy's Head")/[(Varicose Veins)](/wiki/Varicose_Veins "Varicose Veins") [Varicose Veins](/wiki/Varicose_Veins "Varicose Veins"): Generates a halo of tears that don't break their shape.
* [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): While holding a direction, the Ludovico tear will constantly shoot out controllable tears in random directions. The air time of these tears scales with the range stat.
* [(Sprinkler)](/wiki/Sprinkler "Sprinkler") [Sprinkler](/wiki/Sprinkler "Sprinkler"): Sprinkler's tears travel a very short distance in their original direction and can be controlled afterwards.
* [(Proptosis)](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") [Proptosis](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") + [(Anti-Gravity)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): Tears travel and keep their initial size as long as the fire key is held, allowing for massive damage.
* [(Trisagion)](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion") [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion "Trisagion"): The Trisagion beams will fire in the direction of cross-hair and after the fire button is released they stay in place until they fade away.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Anti-Gravity)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): Overridden by Eye of the Occult. Tears up still applies.
* [(Brain Worm)](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm") [Brain Worm](/wiki/Brain_Worm "Brain Worm"): Tears will veer slightly towards enemies when travelling by, but will quickly return to player control.
* [(Chocolate Milk)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): Not Recommended. Releasing the key to fire tears will stop the tear's movement, making it difficult to shoot enemies.
* [(Cursed Eye)](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") [Cursed Eye](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye"): The tears stack on top of each other, and only move forward when holding a direction afterwards.
* [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Bombs will now be controlled both in direction and range.
* [Homing Tears](/wiki/Tear_Effects#Homing "Tear Effects"): Tears still home towards enemies, but controlled movement is stronger than the homing effect.
* [(Immaculate Heart)](/wiki/Immaculate_Heart "Immaculate Heart") [Immaculate Heart](/wiki/Immaculate_Heart "Immaculate Heart"): Extra tears are not affected by Eye of the Occult. Stat changes still apply.
* [(Marked)](/wiki/Marked "Marked") [Marked](/wiki/Marked "Marked"): Tears fired will fly towards the exact crosshair position.
* [(Mom's Knife)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Overrides Eye of the Occult.
* [(My Reflection)](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection") [My Reflection](/wiki/My_Reflection "My Reflection"): Causes the pull to be lessened while actively controlling the tears. Pull returns to normal when not firing.
* [(Pop!)](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") [Pop!](/wiki/Pop! "Pop!") When being actively moved, tears can stay in the air until the fire button is let go.
* [(Tech X)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): Overrides Eye of the Occult.
* [(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"): Creates a controllable crosshair. Lasers are fired towards the crosshair, similar to [(Marked)](/wiki/Marked "Marked") [Marked](/wiki/Marked "Marked").
* [(Tiny Planet)](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") [Tiny Planet](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet"): Not Recommended. The tears will stop moving when not shooting in the direction of their orbit, making it nearly impossible to control where they go.
* [(Tractor Beam)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): Tears will only move forward while being fired, but control is otherwise overridden.
