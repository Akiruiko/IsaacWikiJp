Effects[]
---------


* [Devil Deals](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") and (Black Market) [Black Market](/wiki/Black_Market "Black Market") items can now be paid with [coins](/wiki/Coins "Coins").
	+ Anything that generates Devil Deals (such as [(Satanic Bible)](/wiki/Satanic_Bible "Satanic Bible") [Satanic Bible](/wiki/Satanic_Bible "Satanic Bible") or the special chests in [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room")) will also create items that cost coins.
* Items in (Shop) [Shops](/wiki/Shop "Shop") now cost [health](/wiki/Health "Health").
* [Consumables](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") in shops have no cost, but are surrounded with [spikes](/wiki/Spikes "Spikes") and can't be pushed out with an explosion.


Notes[]
-------


* Buying shop items for health does not prevent (Angel Room) [Angel Rooms](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") from appearing.
* Taking a health consumable surrounded by spikes at a single heart or less will still result in Isaac's death.
* Immunity to spikes does not prevent damage when taking consumables in shops.
* Shop consumables cannot be taken during invincibility frames, e.g. from taking another consumable.
* When transformed into a ghost in [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") II, shop consumables can't be taken even with [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle").
* The item is not available to  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") normally. If acquired through [(Spindown Dice)](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") [Spindown Dice](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice"), [(Death Certificate)](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate") [Death Certificate](/wiki/Death_Certificate "Death Certificate") or such, it has no effect.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Binge Eater)](/wiki/Binge_Eater "Binge Eater") [Binge Eater](/wiki/Binge_Eater "Binge Eater"): All shops become free stat-ups if the food item is chosen.
* [(Restock)](/wiki/Restock "Restock") [Restock](/wiki/Restock "Restock"): The price never increases, staying at one red heart container/three soul hearts for each item, and one full heart of damage for pickups.
	+ With [(Binge Eater)](/wiki/Binge_Eater "Binge Eater") [Binge Eater](/wiki/Binge_Eater "Binge Eater"), this can result in infinite stat gains.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Chaos)](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos") [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos "Chaos"): Items in Devil Rooms that would otherwise cost two heart containers will only cost one if found in Shops.
* [(Flat File)](/wiki/Flat_File "Flat File") [Flat File](/wiki/Flat_File "Flat File"): No effect. Spikes generated surrounding consumables will not be removed.
* [(Isaac's Heart)](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Heart "Isaac's Heart") [Isaac's Heart](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Heart "Isaac's Heart"): Consumables can no longer be picked up in shops.
* [(Judas' Tongue)](/wiki/Judas%27_Tongue "Judas' Tongue") [Judas' Tongue](/wiki/Judas%27_Tongue "Judas' Tongue"): Does not lower Devil Deal prices. No effect on Shops.
* [(Keeper's Box)](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Box "Keeper's Box") [Keeper's Box](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Box "Keeper's Box"): Items and pickups generated outside Devil Rooms will cost health, but items generated inside Devil Rooms will cost coins.
* [(Keeper's Sack)](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Sack "Keeper's Sack") [Keeper's Sack](/wiki/Keeper%27s_Sack "Keeper's Sack"): Because shop items no longer cost coins, stat bonuses are no longer gained from buying shop items.
* [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"): Only one item can be picked up from each shop; any other items will vanish. Consumables can be taken for free.
	+ However, multiple items can be bought from Devil Deals.
	+ Items will disappear when taking any consumable, so take any item first before taking a consumable.
	+ With [(Restock)](/wiki/Restock "Restock") [Restock](/wiki/Restock "Restock"), the Lost can buy items indefinitely.
* [(The Stairway)](/wiki/The_Stairway "The Stairway") [The Stairway](/wiki/The_Stairway "The Stairway"): Affects Angel Shops the same way it does regular shops.
* [(Steam Sale)](/wiki/Steam_Sale "Steam Sale") [Steam Sale](/wiki/Steam_Sale "Steam Sale"): Devil Deals will have their price reduced. Shop items will cost the same amount of health.
* [(Store Credit)](/wiki/Store_Credit "Store Credit") [Store Credit](/wiki/Store_Credit "Store Credit"): Store Credit becomes a useless trinket, as neither Devil Deals nor shop items will become free.
