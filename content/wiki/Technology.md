 # Technology ![image](/image/Technology.png) 


Effects
---------


* Replaces tears with a laser beam with unlimited range and [piercing](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears"). The laser is fired from Isaac's left eye.


Notes
-------


* Laser rate of fire is determined by the [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears") stat. This differentiates the item from [![image](/image/Technology_2.png)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") which fires a continuous beam, and [![image](/image/Tech.5.png)](/wiki/Tech.5 "Tech.5") [Tech.5](/wiki/Tech.5 "Tech.5") which has a random fire rate.
* (Added in Repentance) Laser size scales with tear size.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The sound emitted by the laser will also change depending on its size. This is purely aesthetic.
* (Added in Repentance) Lasers are affected by momentum, allowing them to be shot diagonally if fired while Isaac is moving.
* (Added in Repentance) When directly adjacent to a wall or [obstacle](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles") and firing in the wrong direction the obstacle may block the laser, preventing it from damaging enemies. This can happen on all sides of a given [room](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms") with the exception of the bottom wall.


Synergies
