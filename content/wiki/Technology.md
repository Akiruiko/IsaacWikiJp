Effects[]
---------


* Replaces tears with a laser beam with unlimited range and [piercing](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears"). The laser is fired from Isaac's left eye.


Notes[]
-------


* Laser rate of fire is determined by the [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears") stat. This differentiates the item from [(Technology 2)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") which fires a continuous beam, and [(Tech.5)](/wiki/Tech.5 "Tech.5") [Tech.5](/wiki/Tech.5 "Tech.5") which has a random fire rate.
* (Added in Repentance) Laser size scales with tear size.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The sound emitted by the laser will also change depending on its size. This is purely aesthetic.
* (Added in Repentance) Lasers are affected by momentum, allowing them to be shot diagonally if fired while Isaac is moving.
* (Added in Repentance) When directly adjacent to a wall or [obstacle](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles") and firing in the wrong direction the obstacle may block the laser, preventing it from damaging enemies. This can happen on all sides of a given [room](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms") with the exception of the bottom wall.


Synergies[]
-----------

* (Removed in Afterbirth) [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Overrides Technology.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) The Technology laser coils around the Brimstone beam, granting a 1.5x damage multiplier.
* (Added in Afterbirth) [(Epic Fetus)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Fires lasers in all directions upon impact of a missile.

* [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): The laser becomes a large ring that is controllable and looks like a (Added in Afterbirth)[(Tech X)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") shot. Enemies inside the ring without touching it are not hurt. The shot speed is ignored. The Tears stat is ignored and the damage is dealt very rapidly at a rate equivalent to a 2 tear delay.

* [(Soy Milk)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): Expected high damage down and very high tears up. Because Technology has no knockback like standard tears, this will generally be a good DPS increase.

* (Added in Repentance)[(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") Technology: Adds an additional laser for every extra copy of the item up to a maximum of 16, with no downgrade to damage or tears.

	+ (Added in Afterbirth) [(Tiny Planet)](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") [Tiny Planet](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") + [(A Lump of Coal)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal"): The extra distance covered by the laser more than doubles damage right in front of Isaac, and it increases as normal further away.
