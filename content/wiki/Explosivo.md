 # Explosivo ![image](/image/Explosivo.png) 

Effects
---------


* Isaac's tears have a chance to stick to enemies and explode a few seconds afterward, dealing 60 damage plus Isaac's tear damage.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Tears that stick to enemies do not deal any damage until they explode.
* (Added in Repentance) Explosivo shots deal regular tear damage upon sticking to an enemy.
* If an enemy dies or teleports with an Explosivo tear attached, the tear detaches and drops to the ground. If the detached tears touch an enemy, they will stick to that enemy and explode.
	+ However, when an Explosivo tear is attached to Loki or Lokii, the tear teleports with the respective boss when the boss teleports.
* Be careful with large-sized tears: as Explosivo causes them to grow even larger, they can completely obscure enemies and their surroundings.
* Explosivo is not affected by [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body"): The explosion results in split Explosivo shots being generated. If the target survives, they're likely to immediately stick again.
* (Added in Repentance) [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Dr. Fetus bombs may occasionally turn into [![image](/image/Sticky_Bombs.png)](/wiki/Sticky_Bombs "Sticky Bombs") [Sticky Bombs](/wiki/Sticky_Bombs "Sticky Bombs").
* [![image](/image/Godhead.png)](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead") [Godhead](/wiki/Godhead "Godhead"): The tear keeps its damaging aura while attached to the enemy, the aura grows as the tear does until it explodes. The aura can damage only enemies other than the one the tear is stuck to, however.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Haemolacria.png)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): Main tears and burst tears can have the Explosivo effect. If a main tear has the Explosivo effect, it will burst with its explosion, the burst tears dealing damage based off the explosion damage.
* [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Sticky shots will explode even if they fall to the floor after the initial target dies.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Lachryphagy.png)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Explosivo tears can be fed and will burst into Explosivo tears; however, if normal tears are fed first, Explosivo fed to the normal tears will not give the tear the Explosivo effect.
* [![image](/image/Lost_Contact.png)](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact") [Lost Contact](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact"): Tears that stick to enemies can still block/be destroyed by enemy shots.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Shielded Explosivo tears are no longer destroyed by shots while they're stuck to enemies. Up to the point that they explode, they block all enemy shots that come into contact with them, effectively cutting off an entire direction of attack (much like Dry/Fart Baby, but with a larger area of blockage and without forcing the player to waste time positioning). As such, this is an extremely powerful synergy between otherwise adequate items.
* [![image](/image/Mr._Mega.png)](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") [Mr. Mega](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega"): Increases the damage of Explosivo's explosions to 110.
* [![image](/image/Mysterious_Liquid.png)](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid") [Mysterious Liquid](/wiki/Mysterious_Liquid "Mysterious Liquid"): Leaves a pool of green creep on the floor.
* [![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): The 60 point explosion damage bonus is not affected by Soy Milk's penalty, combining efficiently with the high fire rate.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spirit_Sword.png)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword"): The fired projectile can take on Explosivo's effects. The sword swing can leave behind Explosivo tears.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Technology_Zero.png)](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero") [Technology Zero](/wiki/Technology_Zero "Technology Zero"): Stuck tears will still generate arcs of electricity. Multiple tears stuck to a single enemy can cause very rapid damage.


Interactions
--------------


* [All other bomb modifiers](/wiki/Category:Bomb_items "Category:Bomb items"): No bomb modifier outside [![image](/image/Mr._Mega.png)](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") [Mr. Mega](/wiki/Mr._Mega "Mr. Mega") and (Added in Repentance)[(Short Fuse)](/wiki/Short_Fuse "Short Fuse") [Short Fuse](/wiki/Short_Fuse "Short Fuse") has an effect on Explosivo tears.
* [![image](/image/Bob%27s_Rotten_Head.png)](/wiki/Bob%27s_Rotten_Head "Bob's Rotten Head") [Bob's Rotten Head](/wiki/Bob%27s_Rotten_Head "Bob's Rotten Head"): Bob's Rotten Head has a chance to stick onto enemies. The explosion damage bonus increases to 110.

* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Not recommended.

The constant pull may make the enemy movement unpredictable, however.
