 # Mom's Bracelet ![image](/image/Mom%27s_Bracelet.png) 


Effects
---------


* Upon use, for the next three seconds, any enemy shots that come near Isaac are held in place. After the charge is depleted, they are fired back as tears.
	+ The reflected tears always do 3.5 damage.
* (Added in Repentance) Pushes enemies away for the duration of the item's usage.


Notes
-------


* The tears can be rammed into enemies while they're held by Telekinesis. They won't disappear until the effect ends but do no further damage.
* Catching shots from enemies that fire high into the air, like the [(Tube Worm)](/wiki/Round_Worm#Tube_Worm "Tube Worm") [Tube Worm](/wiki/Round_Worm#Tube_Worm "Round Worm"), is very difficult and not beneficial; in the case of the Tube Worm, shots that are caught will just fall to the ground rather than be fired at enemies.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Tears caught by Telekinesis become wisps. The wisps are outside the range of Telekinesis, making them vulnerable to shots before they can be converted to Wisps.

--------------
