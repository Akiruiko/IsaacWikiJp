 # Mom's Bracelet ![image](/image/Mom%27s_Bracelet.png) 

Effects
---------


* Upon use, picks up the [obstacle](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles") in front of Isaac. The obstacle can be thrown at enemies, dealing 40 damage and breaking on impact, dropping any contents they may contain.
	+ Obstacles can be carried between rooms.
	+ Using it on a [Host](/wiki/Host "Host") will lift the shell off and transform it into a [Red Host](/wiki/Host#Red_Host "Host"). Isaac can throw the shell after picking it up.
	+ Isaac can throw bombs using this, either his bombs or [troll bombs](/wiki/Troll_bomb "Troll bomb").
	+ Friendly [dips](/wiki/Dip "Dip") generated by [![image](/image/Dirty_Mind.png)](/wiki/Dirty_Mind "Dirty Mind") [Dirty Mind](/wiki/Dirty_Mind "Dirty Mind") can be picked up and thrown at enemies.
* This item belongs to the [Yes Mother?](/wiki/Yes_Mother%3F "Yes Mother?") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into his mother.


Notes
-------


* Throwing a [Throwable Bomb](/wiki/Bombs "Bombs") counts as using the bracelet, using up a charge.
* Activating the item again will drop the picked up obstacle where Isaac is standing **without consuming a charge**. This doesn't damage Isaac directly, but any break effects the obstacle has can still occur.
	+ This makes it easy to quickly clear paths through large amounts of rocks.
	+ While the dropped obstacle is falling toward the ground, it can be picked up again by activating Mom's Bracelet.
		- Obstacles thrown by enemies, such as [Polties](/wiki/Polty "Polty"), can be caught in the same way.
* Spiked rocks cannot be picked up, even if their spikes have retracted.
* Throwing a [Giant Poop](/wiki/Poops "Poops") at an enemy deals 320 damage instead of 40.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Three wisps are created where thrown [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacle "Obstacle") land; these wisps rotate around where the obstacle was thrown and fire tears in the same direction Isaac does. The wisps do not persist between rooms. Isaac cannot have more than 8 of these wisps at one time, and wisps in Isaac's Center ring count against this limit. Wisps' tears have a 10% chance of inflicting [confusion](/wiki/Status_Effects "Status Effects") on enemies.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Multidimensional_Baby.png)](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby") [Multidimensional Baby](/wiki/Multidimensional_Baby "Multidimensional Baby"): Rocks thrown through the baby will split into two tears.
* [Stompy](/wiki/Stompy "Stompy") transformation: Isaac will raise his hands, but is unable to pick up any rocks, effectively rendering the bracelet useless. Can still be used on [Hosts](/wiki/Host "Host").
