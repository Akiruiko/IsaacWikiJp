* All damage taken is reduced to half a heart.


Notes[]
-------


* The damage reduction includes most sources in the game that would cause more than half a heart of damage:
	+ [Bombs](/wiki/Pickups#Bombs "Pickups").
	+ [Champions](/wiki/Champion "Champion").
		- Except for the skull champions, they will deal a full heart damage even with The Wafer as opposed to only one half.
	+ [Sacrifice Rooms](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room").
	+ Environmental hazards such as [Spikes](/wiki/Spikes "Spikes").
	+ Most self-inflicting damage items (exceptions are noted).
	+ Every source of damage in [(Womb)](/wiki/Womb "Womb") [Womb](/wiki/Womb "Womb")/[(Utero)](/wiki/Utero "Utero") [Utero](/wiki/Utero "Utero")/[(Scarred Womb)](/wiki/Scarred_Womb "Scarred Womb") [Scarred Womb](/wiki/Scarred_Womb "Scarred Womb") and beyond, including all enemies, [curse rooms](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room"), [blood donation machines](/wiki/Blood_Donation_Machine "Blood Donation Machine"), and [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_Beggar "Devil Beggar").
	+ The "HARD HARD" special [seed](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds").
* The Wafer does not prevent instant death effects such as [(Suicide King)](/wiki/Suicide_King "Suicide King") [Suicide King](/wiki/Suicide_King "Suicide King") or using [(The Bible)](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") [The Bible](/wiki/The_Bible "The Bible") on the [Satan](/wiki/Satan "Satan") boss fight.
* Does not prevent health loss from [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") deals or Health Down [pills](/wiki/Pills "Pills").
* Despite The Wafer reducing damage to 1/2 a heart, this does not change the amount of invincibility frames granted from full/two heart damage sources.
* (Added in Afterbirth) No effect with  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") or (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"), as Coin Hearts cannot be half hearts.
* (Added in Repentance) Does not reduce the damage taken when opening the door to [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum")/[(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna").
