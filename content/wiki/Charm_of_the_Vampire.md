 # Charm of the Vampire ![image](/image/Charm_of_the_Vampire.png) 


Effects
---------


* Upon use, sacrifices up to 2 [familiars](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") and spawns an item from the [Devil Room pool](/wiki/Devil_Room_(Item_Pool) "Devil Room (Item Pool)") for each familiar sacrificed.
	+ The order in which the familiars were obtained does not matter; it picks 2 at random to sacrifice.
	+ If Isaac has no familiars, no [Blue Flies](/wiki/Blue_Fly "Blue Fly"), and no [Blue Spiders](/wiki/Blue_Spider "Blue Spider"), the item will do nothing and will not be consumed.
		- Even if Isaac doesn't have any familiars, if he has a single fly, spider, or locust, the item will be consumed.
	+ If the Devil Room pool has no items left, one or two copies of [![image](/image/Pentagram.png)](/wiki/Pentagram "Pentagram") [Pentagram](/wiki/Pentagram "Pentagram") are spawned.
	+ When playing [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode"), the normal Devil Room pool is still used, instead of the Greed mode pool.
* In addition to the familiars, any [Blue Flies](/wiki/Blue_Fly "Blue Fly"), [Blue Spiders](/wiki/Blue_Spider "Blue Spider"), or [Locusts](/wiki/Locust "Locust") will be converted to 1 Penny each.
* On use, causes a brief [(Curse of Darkness.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/4/4f/Curse_of_Darkness.png/revision/latest?cb=20211023084927) [Curse of Darkness](/wiki/Curses "Curses") effect for a few seconds.


Notes
-------


* If playing as  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith"), the [![image](/image/Incubus.png)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") familiar cannot be sacrificed.
* [Charmed](/wiki/Charm "Charm") and [friendly](/wiki/Friendly "Friendly") enemies cannot be sacrificed.
* Any [Pretty Flies](/wiki/Pretty_Fly "Pretty Fly") are counted as a single sacrifice.
* Familiars spawned from [Trinkets](/wiki/Trinkets "Trinkets") like [(Isaac's Head)](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Head "Isaac's Head") [Isaac's Head](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Head "Isaac's Head") can be sacrificed, destroying the trinket in the process.
