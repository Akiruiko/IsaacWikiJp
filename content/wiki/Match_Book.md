Effects[]
---------


* Upon use, Isaac fires a giant, incredibly powerful blood laser, similar to the one used by [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan"), for 15 seconds.
	+ The beam deals Isaac's current damage multiplied by 5 per tick.
	+ The beam has enough power to push Isaac backward while being fired and will last between rooms, and across multiple floors.
	+ The beam has spectral and piercing effects.
	+ The beam can be moved while firing in many angles diagonally.
	+ While Mega Blast is being fired, Isaac cannot:
		- Open [chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests").
		- Pick up a [Little Battery](/wiki/Little_Battery "Little Battery"), collectibles, [pills](/wiki/Pill "Pill"), [trinkets](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket"), or [cards or runes](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes").
		- Pick up the trophy or enter the chest that spawns after defeating [Isaac](/wiki/Isaac_(Boss) "Isaac (Boss)"), [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Boss) "??? (Boss)") [Satan](/wiki/Satan "Satan"), [The Lamb](/wiki/The_Lamb "The Lamb"), [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") (sometimes), or [Delirium](/wiki/Delirium "Delirium").
		- Sleep in a [bed](/wiki/Bed "Bed").
	+ The laser extinguishes fires, detonates TNT, and destroys poop.


Notes[]
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Picking up a Little Battery with this item will not fully charge it. Instead, it will add 3 to its charge, meaning that 4 batteries are required to fully recharge the item.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) A [Charged Key](/wiki/Charged_Key "Charged Key") will only add 3 charges as well.
		- (Added in Repentance) Little Batteries and Charged Keys add 6 charges instead of 3.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Picking up a Mega Battery will fully charge it twice.
* Using a [48 Hour Energy](/wiki/48_Hour_Energy "48 Hour Energy") pill with this item will fully charge it.
* Mega Blast has an 80% decreased item pool weight, making it less likely to appear than other collectibles.
* To unlock Mega Blast, Mega Satan must be defeated with all 13 characters.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth †) Requires defeating Mega Satan as all 15 characters (Now including [(Apollyon)](/wiki/Apollyon "Apollyon") [Apollyon](/wiki/Apollyon "Apollyon") and  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten")).
		- (Added in Repentance) Requires defeating Mega Satan as all 17 non-tainted characters. (Now including  [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") and  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"))
* (Added in Repentance) It is not recommended to use Mega Blast in fight with [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast"), because its beam forces you into obstacles on the level.

* (Added in Repentance)[(4.5 Volt)](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") [4.5 Volt](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt"): Item will gain charges for dealing damage, which is especially effective when fighting bosses with large health pool.

Lasers can hit up to 8 times for a total of 20 damage. If Mega Blast is being used, the wisps will continuously fire their laser outward rather than in the direction Mega Blast is firing.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Schoolbag)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"): Beam will continue to fire when switching to another active item. Other active items can be used while the beam is firing.
