Effects[]
---------


* The first ball creates an [Orbital Familiar](/wiki/Orbital_Familiar "Orbital Familiar") that deals (Removed in Repentance) 105/(Added in Repentance) 56 damage per second.
* (Removed in Afterbirth) Unlike the [(Cube of Meat)](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") [Cube of Meat](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat"), it does not block enemy shots.
* Each subsequent Ball of Bandages obtained are combined with the first one (increasing its 'level'), changing its characteristics:
	+ Level 2: Gives the orbital the ability to shoot [Charm](/wiki/Charm "Charm") tears that deal 3.5 damage every (Removed in Repentance) 1/(Added in Repentance) 0.66 second(s).
	+ Level 3: Changes it from an orbital to a Bandage Girl that that chases nearby enemies dealing (Removed in Repentance) 7/(Added in Repentance) 10 contact damage per second, and fires Charm tears in the direction Isaac shoots. The tears it fires are the same as the ones fired by the Level 2 form.
	+ Level 4: Increases the size of the Bandage Girl and increases its contact damage to (Removed in Repentance) 11/(Added in Repentance) 20 per second. Enemies killed by a level 4 Bandage Girl's tears have a chance to drop full [(Red Heart)](/wiki/Red_Heart "Red Heart") [Red Hearts](/wiki/Red_Heart "Red Heart").
	+ The fifth Ball of Bandages will create a new Level 1 ball, and start the cycle again.


Notes[]
-------


* Multiple Balls of Bandages can be collected in a single run.
* (Added in Repentance) The orbital orbits Isaac significantly faster, making it more effective at blocking shots but less effective for dealing damage.
* [(Famine)](/wiki/Famine "Famine") [Famine](/wiki/Famine "Famine"), [(Pestilence)](/wiki/Pestilence "Pestilence") [Pestilence](/wiki/Pestilence "Pestilence"), [(War)](/wiki/War "War") [War](/wiki/War "War"), and [(Death)](/wiki/Death_(Boss)#Death "Death") [Death](/wiki/Death_(Boss)#Death "Death (Boss)") will always drop either a Ball of Bandages or [(Cube of Meat)](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat") [Cube of Meat](/wiki/Cube_of_Meat "Cube of Meat"). After the first one drops, further Harbingers will only drop that same one and never the other for the duration of the run.
* The ticking rate for Bandage Girls' contact damage causes them to often deal damage twice once they touch an enemy, making their first second of DPS up to 1.5x higher than normal.
* Level 3 and 4 Bandage Girls' tears inherit Isaac's momentum.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Book of Revelations)](/wiki/Book_of_Revelations "Book of Revelations") [Book of Revelations](/wiki/Book_of_Revelations "Book of Revelations"): Ensures that [Harbingers](/wiki/Harbingers "Harbingers") that haven't already been defeated will replace their respective floor's boss, making it drastically easier to collect multiple Balls of Bandages.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Box of Friends)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") / [(Monster Manual)](/wiki/Monster_Manual "Monster Manual") [Monster Manual](/wiki/Monster_Manual "Monster Manual"): Additional copies of Ball of Bandages combine with the first, increasing its level as normal.


Interactions[]
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[(Duct Tape)](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape") [Duct Tape](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape"): Familiar will stay in place relative to Isaac at levels 1 and 2. No effect at levels 3 and 4.
* [Pretty Fly](/wiki/Pretty_Fly "Pretty Fly"): Ball of Bandages will replace one if Isaac already has 3 Pretty Flies. If the Ball of Bandages reaches level 3 or 4, the Pretty Fly will come back until another Ball of Bandages orbital is obtained.
