Notes[]
-------


* The damage of the laser scales directly with Isaac's damage.
* Unlike [(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology") or [(Technology 2)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2"), Isaac can still fire tears from both eyes in addition to firing the laser.
* The laser can be fired independently from tears by slightly tilting the right analog stick, just like shooting familiars.
* (Added in Repentance) Unlike [(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"), Tech.5 Lasers do not have momentum, and fire exclusively in the cardinal directions unless Isaac has an item like (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[(Analog Stick)](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick") [Analog Stick](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick"), (Added in Repentance)[(Eye of the Occult)](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult") [Eye of the Occult](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Occult "Eye of the Occult") or (Added in Afterbirth)[(Marked)](/wiki/Marked "Marked") [Marked](/wiki/Marked "Marked").


Interactions[]
--------------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Anti-Gravity)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): Creates floating laser balls that will all fire simultaneously when the fire button is released.
* [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Tech.5 does not fire. However, it will still fire when playing as  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") with his short-ranged Brimstone. Since the laser scales with player damage, this can be a devastating combination.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Tech.5 fires normally while Brimstone laser is charging.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Cricket's Body)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body"): Tear delay down as expected, but no benefit from the splash effect.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Releases a 4-way spread of tears whenever the laser hits a wall or an enemy.
* (Added in Afterbirth)  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith"): No effect, as Lilith is inherently Blindfolded.
* [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Laser is fired in the same direction that the controlled tear is moving.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Ipecac)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Laser explodes and poisons enemies on contact.
* [(Rubber Cement)](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement") [Rubber Cement](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement"): Laser will bounce in angle depending on the obstacle hit.
