 # Piggy Bank ![image](/image/Piggy_Bank.png) 

Effects
---------


* Adds 3 [coins](/wiki/Coins "Coins") on pickup.
* When Isaac takes damage, there is an equal chance for 1 or 2 [Pennies](/wiki/Penny "Penny") to drop.
	+ When held by  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") or  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"), it will drop 0-1 pennies instead.


Notes
-------


* If  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") or  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") collects this item with 1 health coin, it will heal a coin and add 2 coins to his inventory.
	+ (Added in Repentance) If  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") has unlocked a third health coin, collecting this item may heal 2 health coins and only provide a single coin to his inventory, depending on whether he has 1 health coin remaining or 2.
* Unlike the coins dropped from being hit by a shot from a [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper_(Enemy) "Keeper (Enemy)"), [Greed](/wiki/Greed "Greed"), or [Super Greed](/wiki/Super_Greed "Super Greed"), the coins that are dropped from the piggy bank are not subtracted from Isaac's total.
* Can appear in the shop and the item room on the same floor, but picking up multiple copies of the item does not cause its effect to stack.
* The drops from Piggy Bank, unlike [(Swallowed Penny)](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny") [Swallowed Penny](/wiki/Swallowed_Penny "Swallowed Penny"), are locked to normal pennies, instead of random types of coins.
