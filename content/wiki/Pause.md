 # Pause ![image](/image/Pause.png) 

Effects
---------


* Stops all enemies including bosses until a fire button is pressed.
	+ This does not affect troll bombs.
	+ Touching frozen enemies will still damage Isaac.
	+ Co-op babies can fire without ending the effect.
	+ Stops [fireplaces](/wiki/Fireplaces "Fireplaces") from shooting projectiles.
	+ Using (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Dark_Arts.png)](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts") [Dark Arts](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts") will not stop the effect.
	+ Bosses will resume their actions after 30 seconds have passed, while non-boss enemies (except [Lil' Haunt](/wiki/Lil%27_Haunt_(Enemy) "Lil' Haunt (Enemy)")) are still paused.
		- (Added in Repentance) All enemies resume actions after 30 seconds
	+ [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten")'s Soul will be able to extend far past the normal limits of the chain when activated while  [![image](/image/The_Soul.png)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)") is out.


Notes
-------


* New enemies generated during Pause being active will not be frozen and act normally. This applies for spawn-upon-death effects such as [Attack Flies](/wiki/Attack_Fly "Attack Fly") created by a [Moter](/wiki/Moter "Moter"), or a Boss that stopped becoming frozen and began summoning enemies.
* Damage against paused multi-segmented bosses works unpredictably, most notably allowing you to damage [Scolex](/wiki/Scolex "Scolex") on normally invulnerable parts.
	+ The health bars of multi-segmented bosses may not be updated properly, making it seem as if they died without running out of health.
* Reducing a boss to zero health whilst they are paused will initiate their death animation but they will not die until a fire button is pressed or the 30 second timer has lapsed.
* Pausing in the room before entering the minecart in the [(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines") causes the minecart to freeze, trapping the player inside of it until they exit to the main menu.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/120_Volt.png)](/wiki/120_Volt "120 Volt") [120 Volt](/wiki/120_Volt "120 Volt"): 120 volt continues to damage enemies even while paused, allowing for insane amounts of damage.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns green wisps on the middle ring. Wisps pause all enemies and enemy shots for 3 seconds when destroyed. This effect is not cancelled by shooting tears.
* Items that can be used without firing, such a Mom's knife and orbitals can do massive amounts of damage.
	+ Any item that does damage without firing + (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/4.5_Volt.png)](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") [4.5 Volt](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt"): Pause can be recharged while the effect is active, allowing for potentially infinite uptime.
* [(Tainted Jacob)](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob") [Tainted Jacob](/wiki/Tainted_Jacob "Tainted Jacob"): Dark Esau will also be affected by Pause. With proper timing, this allows him to melt through endgame bosses with large amounts of armor-piercing damage by having Dark Esau sit on top of them.
* [(Collectible The Ludovico Technique icon.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/e/e4/Collectible_The_Ludovico_Technique_icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20210821050321) [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): The giant tear keeps dealing damage in stopped time, making it for easy boss kills.

Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | If you activate and resume "Pause" while an enemy emits projectiles, the bullets won't proceed with regular but instead extremely decreased speed. However, the will still pass intended range, which bypasses the effect of shot speed being reduced as it normally would with any items that slow projectiles down.
