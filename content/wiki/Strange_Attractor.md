 # Strange Attractor ![image](/image/Strange_Attractor.png) 

Effect
--------


* [Monsters](/wiki/Monster "Monster"), [pickups](/wiki/Pickup "Pickup"), and [trinkets](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket") are magnetically attracted to the player character's tears.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) This also applies to Isaac's bombs.
		- (Added in Repentance) Items will be attracted to where the magnetic tear lands.
	+ The effect may not affect certain immobile enemies; [Round Worms](/wiki/Round_Worm "Round Worm") will start to vibrate in the presence of multiple magnetic tears, but will not change their position, [Hosts](/wiki/Host "Host") will only be attracted when readying to launch an attack.


Notes
-------


* Extra caution must be taken when using this item, as the attraction effect will pull small, lightweight monsters like [Boom Flies](/wiki/Boom_Fly "Boom Fly") towards the character very fast and in an unpredictable manner, with the consequent risk of taking damage.
* (Added in Repentance) This item has been reworked and doesn't function like usual anymore. Now tears will attract only when the tear lands on the ground/sticks to an enemy.

* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Explosivo.png)](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo") [Explosivo](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo"): When the shot sticks to an enemy, every enemy near it will be attracted to them.

* [![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Enemies and pickups are pulled towards the shots, increasing accuracy. The color of shots and their explosive effect is a darker green.
* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Enemies, items, and even most bosses will be sucked to the single floating tear, dealing constant damage while keeping Isaac well away from harm, making this combination extremely effective in almost all scenarios.
* [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife"): Enemies are pulled towards the knife. The effect is minor while not firing and much stronger while the knife is launched.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Nose Goblin)](/wiki/Nose_Goblin "Nose Goblin") [Nose Goblin](/wiki/Nose_Goblin "Nose Goblin")/(Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Sinus_Infection.png)](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") [Sinus Infection](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection"): Attraction effect will remain on the booger shot stuck to an enemy. This can drag the enemy across the whole room until they reach one wall and get stuck on it, effectively disabling their normal movement.
* (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"): Tainted Forgotten attracts enemies, putting them in range of his bone club attack.
* [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology")/[![image](/image/Technology_2.png)](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2") [Technology 2](/wiki/Technology_2 "Technology 2")/[![image](/image/Tech.5.png)](/wiki/Tech.5 "Tech.5") [Tech.5](/wiki/Tech.5 "Tech.5"): The beam will attract enemies, often sucking them into the beam and holding them there.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Tech_X.png)](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X") [Tech X](/wiki/Tech_X "Tech X"): Enemies and pickups are attracted to the outer ring, increasing accuracy.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Tractor_Beam.png)](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam") [Tractor Beam](/wiki/Tractor_Beam "Tractor Beam"): The lack of random spread and momentum-based trajectories on tears makes the way enemies are pulled around more predictable.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body")/(Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Compound_Fracture.png)](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") [Compound Fracture](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture"): Since tears will split into more tears, all traveling different directions, enemies will be randomly moved around.
* [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Overrides Strange Attractor.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth) Enemies get drawn towards the target mark on the ground, ensuring that the missile will hit.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Explosivo.png)](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo") [Explosivo](/wiki/Explosivo "Explosivo"): Enemies will be pulled toward the stuck on tears, dragging them helplessly or grouping them for the explosion.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Haemolacria.png)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): Enemies and pickups are attracted to the main tear, but not burst tears.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Lachryphagy.png)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Enemies will often get sucked into tears, making it more difficult to feed tears or let them burst.
* [![image](/image/Monstro%27s_Lung.png)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"): Due to the high concentration of tears, enemies will be pulled towards Isaac at great force; in certain cases, enough force will be generated to pull enemies through rocks. This can greatly increase accuracy but depending on enemies' movements and positions can also damage Isaac.
* [![image](/image/The_Parasite.png)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Enemies will be pulled towards both fired tears and split tears. However, because they both travel in opposite directions, the split tears' magnetic effects tend to cancel each other out.
* [![image](/image/Rubber_Cement.png)](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement") [Rubber Cement](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement"): Due to tears being reflected, enemies tend to be pulled towards Isaac with much force. Additionally, the random angle of tears being reflected results in erratic enemy movement. **Not recommended.**
* [![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): The rapid tears will pull enemies quickly and erratically around the room. **Not recommended.**
