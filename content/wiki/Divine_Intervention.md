 # Divine Intervention ![image](/image/Divine_Intervention.png) 


Effects
---------


* Double tapping a fire key creates a Divine Shield that slowly moves in the chosen direction.
* The Divine Shield has a variety of effects.
	+ Enemies are pushed back in the opposite direction, completely reversing their trajectory with some added momentum.
		- If they hit a wall or obstacle while being pushed, they take 10 damage and deal 10 damage to enemies they hit. The damages are increased by 2 for each floor.
	+ Enemy tears are reflected, dealing damage back to enemies depending on the source of the tear.
		- The reflected projectiles deal 6 damage if they would've hurt Isaac for half a heart, and 7 for a full heart.
		- Reflected projectiles do not gain [Tear effects](/wiki/Tear_effects "Tear effects") from Isaac.
			* Explosive projectiles (e.g. from [(Gurgle)](/wiki/Gaper#Gurgle "Gurgle") [Gurgle](/wiki/Gaper#Gurgle "Gaper")) explode as normal, dealing as much damage they would've.
			* Projectiles that create other projectiles (e.g. [(Shady)](/wiki/Fatty#Shady "Shady") [Shady](/wiki/Fatty#Shady "Fatty")) can harm Isaac and be reflected.
			* Homing projectiles (e.g. from [(Psychic Horf)](/wiki/Horf#Psychic_Horf "Psychic Horf") [Psychic Horf](/wiki/Horf#Psychic_Horf "Horf")) do not retain their homing effect after being reflected.
		- Can reflect:
			* Fire projectiles (e.g. from [(Mega Satan)](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan")).
			* Obstacles thrown by [(Polty)](/wiki/Polty "Polty") [Polty](/wiki/Polty "Polty") or [(Kineti)](/wiki/Polty#Kineti "Kineti") [Kineti](/wiki/Polty#Kineti "Polty"), dealing a flat 35 damage.
		- Does not reflect:
			* Lines of fire (e.g. from [(Dragon Fly)](/wiki/Boom_Fly#Dragon_Fly "Dragon Fly") [Dragon Fly](/wiki/Boom_Fly#Dragon_Fly "Boom Fly")), but can reflect fireballs (e.g. from [(Crackle)](/wiki/Gaper#Crackle "Crackle") [Crackle](/wiki/Gaper#Crackle "Gaper")) and their lines of fire do not harm Isaac.
			* Projectiles from [(Big Bony)](/wiki/Fatty#Big_Bony "Big Bony") [Big Bony](/wiki/Fatty#Big_Bony "Fatty"), [(Coal Boy)](/wiki/Danny#Coal_Boy "Coal Boy") [Coal Boy](/wiki/Danny#Coal_Boy "Danny"), [(Danny)](/wiki/Danny "Danny") [Danny](/wiki/Danny "Danny").
	+ Enemy Brimstone lasers are reflected, dealing 7 damage per tick (105 damage per second) to enemies hit by the reflection. It can even deflect the colossal brimstone laser fired by [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast").
		- White beams, such as those used by [Dogma](/wiki/Dogma "Dogma") in its second phase, are reflected into holy beams similar to those fired by [![image](/image/Revelation.png)](/wiki/Revelation "Revelation") [Revelation](/wiki/Revelation "Revelation").
* The shield lasts 1 second, and has a cooldown of 3 seconds.
* This item belongs to the [Seraphim](/wiki/Seraphim_(Transformation) "Seraphim (Transformation)") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into an angel.


Notes
-------


* If any charged item is obtained along with Divine Intervention e.g. [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") or Revelation, a different fire key may be pressed to put out the shield without forfeiting the charge of said item.
