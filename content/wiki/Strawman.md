 # Strawman ![image](/image/Strawman.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") as an extra character alongside Isaac, who is controlled exactly like  [(Esau)](/wiki/Esau "Esau") [Esau](/wiki/Esau "Esau").
	+ Keeper will have his base stats and use coins as health.
	+ He will not receive any of his starting items, such as [![image](/image/Wooden_Nickel.png)](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel") [Wooden Nickel](/wiki/Wooden_Nickel "Wooden Nickel") or [(Store Key)](/wiki/Store_Key "Store Key") [Store Key](/wiki/Store_Key "Store Key").
* When Keeper dies, he spawns 5 [blue spiders](/wiki/Blue_spider "Blue spider") and Strawman is removed from Isaac's inventory.
* Grants 1 [(Bomb)](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb") [Bomb](/wiki/Bomb "Bomb") upon pickup.
* For as long as Keeper is alive, reduces all damage dealt to [bosses](/wiki/Bosses "Bosses") by 20%.


Notes
-------


* Keeper's health is displayed at all times above his head.
	+ If [(Curse of the Unknown.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/5/55/Curse_of_the_Unknown.png/revision/latest?cb=20211023085127) [Curse of the Unknown](/wiki/Curses "Curses") is in effect, his health bar will be hidden the same way as Isaac's.
	+ Keeper will start with 2 coin hearts or 3 if the [(Keeper now holds... A Penny!)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper now holds... A Penny!") [Keeper now holds... A Penny!](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") achievement is unlocked.
* Keeper is able to pick up items independently from Isaac. He has his own inventory.
	+ This inventory is not displayed on the HUD.
	+ When Keeper dies, the items he obtained are permanently removed.
		- This includes quest items like [![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid"), potentially leaving you unable to progress.
* Keeper is not able to pick up any active items, trinkets, or consumables.
* Keeper cannot pick up any type of hearts, except for [(Gold Heart)](/wiki/Gold_Heart "Gold Heart") [Gold Hearts](/wiki/Gold_Heart "Gold Heart").
	+ Eternal Hearts can also be picked up, but to no effect, effectively wasting them.
* Keeper's speed is independent from Isaac's and does not sync like with  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"). Obtaining speed items will grant speed only to the one that picked up the item.
* (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") items will cost money instead of health as long as Keeper is alive.
* When placing a bomb, Keeper will place another at no cost.
* Keeper can be used to play (Sacrifice Room) [Sacrifice Rooms](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room") at the cost of coins instead of hearts.
* Keeper is not able to walk through doors or into (Crawl Space) [Crawl Space](/wiki/Crawl_Space "Crawl Space"), although he is able to enter the beam of light that takes Isaac to the next floor after the [(Mom's Heart)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") / [(It Lives)](/wiki/It_Lives "It Lives") [It Lives](/wiki/It_Lives "It Lives") fight, the one spawned by [![image](/image/Genesis.png)](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis") [Genesis](/wiki/Genesis "Genesis"), as well as entering the big chest after defeating bosses in later stages.
* Respawn items work as normal for Keeper. (see Interactions)
* If Keeper plays a [(Blood Donation Machine.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/6/6e/Blood_Donation_Machine.png/revision/latest?cb=20210821075842) [Blood Donation Machine](/wiki/Machines#Blood_Donation_Machine "Machines"), it will pay out with 0-1 coins.
* [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") unlocks cannot be earned using Strawman.
* Similar to  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"), it is possible to take both items between item choice pedestals with careful positioning.
* Even though Keeper is considered a second character, the run ends if Isaac dies.
* Technically, Strawman is marked as a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") item in the game's files, although most familiar-modifying items, such as [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") don't have any effect on Keeper.
* Unlike Jacob and Esau, invincibility frames are not shared between Keeper and Isaac.
* If collected in a challenge where Isaac is blindfolded, Keeper will be blindfolded too.
* Re-emerging from the part of [(Mines)](/wiki/Mines "Mines") [Mines](/wiki/Mines "Mines") II where [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") is hidden will cause Strawman to be regenerated from scratch. This permanently remove all items the summoned Keeper had collected up until that point.
* If Strawman is picked up during the second lap of a [Victory Lap](/wiki/Victory_Lap "Victory Lap"), he will become  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") alongside Isaac on every subsequent lap.

* [![image](/image/Sanguine_Bond.png)](/wiki/Sanguine_Bond "Sanguine Bond") [Sanguine Bond](/wiki/Sanguine_Bond "Sanguine Bond"): A very beneficial item for both Isaac and Keeper, as it is fairly easy to snowball into infinitely playing the spikes.
* [![image](/image/Yum_Heart.png)](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart") [Yum Heart](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart"): Because of how Yum Heart works in co-op, when Isaac uses Yum Heart, it will also restore one coin heart for Keeper.
