 # AAA Battery ![image](/image/AAA_Battery.png) 

Effect
--------


* If an activated item would regain its penultimate charge upon clearing a room, it is instead fully charged. This effectively reduces its charge time by one bar.


Notes
-------


* Does not affect items with only one bar of charge or those with automatic recharge.
* Recharging an item by taking damage with [(Habit)](/wiki/Habit "Habit") [Habit](/wiki/Habit "Habit"), the instant charge given by [(9 Volt)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt"), or any source of charge other than clearing a room, will not activate the trinket's effect.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[(Schoolbag)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"): The trinket activates based on the primary item slot, but it grants an extra point of charge to the second item as well.
* [(9 Volt)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt"): If active item requires three or more charges, trinket gives an extra charge, effectively utilizing itself with 9 Volt.


Interactions
--------------


* [(The Battery)](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery") [The Battery](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery"): No effect on the second level charge.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Watch_Battery.png)](/wiki/Watch_Battery "Watch Battery") [Watch Battery](/wiki/Watch_Battery "Watch Battery"): Watch Battery triggering after clearing a room will also trigger AAA Battery, provided the activated item was missing exactly 3 charges prior to clearing the room.
