 # Broken Padlock ![image](/image/Broken_Padlock.png) 

Effects
---------


* Doors that require a [key](/wiki/Key "Key"), [coin](/wiki/Coin "Coin") or a [heart](/wiki/Heart "Heart") can be opened with explosions.
* Does *not* work on (Challenge Room) [Challenge Room](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room") doors (neither Normal Challenge Room, nor Boss Challenge Room)
	+ Does *not* work on the golden door that leads to [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan") or the flesh door to [Mom's Heart](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heart "Mom's Heart") in [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum")/[(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna").
	+ The door to the [(Mausoleum)](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum") [Mausoleum](/wiki/Mausoleum "Mausoleum")/[(Gehenna)](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") [Gehenna](/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") can be entered with one bomb without the need to spend any hearts.
	+ [The Strange Door](/wiki/A_Strange_Door "A Strange Door") can also be opened without the need to sacrifice [(The Polaroid)](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") [The Polaroid](/wiki/The_Polaroid "The Polaroid") / [(The Negative)](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative") [The Negative](/wiki/The_Negative "The Negative").
* [Chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest") can also be opened with an explosion.
	+ This includes all types of chests, including [Mimic](/wiki/Mimic "Mimic") and [Spiked Chests](/wiki/Spiked_Chest "Spiked Chest") with the only exceptions being [Haunted Chests](/wiki/Chest#Haunted_Chest "Chest") and [Mom's Chest](/wiki/Chest#Mom.27s_Chest "Chest").


Notes
-------


* Doors that require two keys ((Vault) [Vault](/wiki/Vault "Vault") and (Dice Room) [Dice Room](/wiki/Dice_Room "Dice Room")) only require one bomb to open.
* The trinket allows bombing through locked doors, such as (Treasure Room) [Treasure Rooms](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room") and (Arcade) [Arcades](/wiki/Arcade "Arcade") before the room has been cleared which is normally not possible.
	+ However, if the door has already been unlocked, this will not work.
* [Mega Chests](/wiki/Mega_Chest "Mega Chest") require multiple explosions in order to be opened, just as when using keys.


Synergies
-----------


* [(Options?)](/wiki/Options%3F "Options?") [Options?](/wiki/Options%3F "Options?"): Bombing any chest spawned by Options?, including the ones not requiring keys, allows picking up the contents of the chest without the other reward disappearing, unless the empty chest is touched. This can be easily avoided by simply exiting and reentering the room.


* [(Sulfuric Acid)](/wiki/Sulfuric_Acid "Sulfuric Acid") [Sulfuric Acid](/wiki/Sulfuric_Acid "Sulfuric Acid") / [(Terra)](/wiki/Terra "Terra") [Terra](/wiki/Terra "Terra"): Locked doors can be opened by shooting at them.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Blue_Key.png)](/wiki/Blue_Key "Blue Key") [Blue Key](/wiki/Blue_Key "Blue Key"): Doors opened via explosions will not spawn the corridor.


* [(Golden Trinket)](/wiki/Golden_Trinket "Golden Trinket") [Golden Trinket](/wiki/Golden_Trinket "Golden Trinket") / [(Mom's Box)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box") [Mom's Box](/wiki/Mom%27s_Box "Mom's Box"): No effect.
* [(Pay to Play)](/wiki/Pay_to_Play "Pay to Play") [Pay to Play](/wiki/Pay_to_Play "Pay to Play"): Doors can still be opened up normally via explosions.
