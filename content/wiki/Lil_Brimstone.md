Effect
--------


* Grants a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that fires a thin [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") beam. It needs to be charged up; it will not fire if Isaac is shooting a steady stream of tears.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The beam deals 3.5 damage per tick and can strike an enemy up to 9 times, for a total of 31.5 damage.
		- (Added in Repentance) The beam deals 2.5 damage per tick and can strike an enemy up to 8 times, for a total of 20 damage.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Unlike Brimstone, Lil Brimstone can start charging up a beam while still firing the previous one.
* (Added in Repentance) This item belongs to the [Conjoined](/wiki/Conjoined "Conjoined") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a three-faced version of himself.


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Afterbirth) Lil Brimstone is a [special item](/wiki/Special_Item "Special Item").
* (Added in Repentance) Lil Brimstone takes priority over all other following familiars aside from [![image](/image/Incubus.png)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus"), and will always appear first in line directly behind Isaac or second behind Incubus.
* Unlike other Brimstone items, Lil Brimstone can begin charging while firing.
