Effects[]
---------


* (Removed in Repentance) Doubles Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") stat.
* (Added in Repentance) +0.5 damage.
* Tear size multiplier: 2x.
* (Removed in Repentance) The tears shrink and lose damage the farther they travel.
* (Added in Repentance) The tears shrink and lose damage the more time they stay airborne, starting at 3x damage at point blank range. After a fixed period of time, they deal no damage at all.


Notes[]
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Effective range of Isaac's tears now also depends on the damage, as they can shrink out of existence before their air time runs out.
* (Added in Repentance) Since tears run out of damage after a fixed amount of time, shot speed is the only stat that determines the effective range of Isaac's tears. Damage and range don't affect the travel distance at all.
* (Removed in Repentance) Tear size increasing items also increase the maximum distance before its disappearance, but the damage dealt can go below original at the extreme.
* The item has the opposite effect of the item [(A Lump of Coal)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal"), which makes Isaac deal more damage from farther away.
* (Removed in Repentance) Does not affect  [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") short-ranged [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") unless the range stat is *extremely* high.


Synergies[]
