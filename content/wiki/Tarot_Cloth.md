Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance)Tarot Cloth's effect also applies to card effects used through [![image](/image/Blank_Card.png)](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") [Blank Card](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card").
	+ (Removed in Repentance) As a result, using the Blank Card in conjunction with the [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") will cause the effect of the active card to quadruple, instead of double.
