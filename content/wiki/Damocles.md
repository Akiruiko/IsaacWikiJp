 # Damocles ![image](/image/Damocles.png) 


Effects
---------


* Upon use, summons a sword that hangs directly above Isaac. As long as the sword hangs above Isaac, all [item](/wiki/Item "Item") pedestals and items spawned from [Machines](/wiki/Machines "Machines") and [Beggars](/wiki/Beggar "Beggar") are doubled, spawning an additional free item next to them.
	+ The extra item spawned will be pulled from the current room's item pool.
	+ [(Mega Chest)](/wiki/Mega_Chest "Mega Chest") [Mega Chests](/wiki/Mega_Chest "Mega Chest") will also spawn an extra item if they contained items.
* After Isaac gets hit once with the item activated, at any time with only a brief warning, the sword may fall, instantly killing Isaac regardless of his health. The sword has a 1/10000 chance every 4 frames to fall, so on average, 50% of all Damocles runs will not drop the sword until after at least 15 minutes and 24 seconds have passed.
	+ Self-damage (such as from a [(Blood Donation Machine.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/6/6e/Blood_Donation_Machine.png/revision/latest?cb=20210821075842) [Blood Donation Machine](/wiki/Machines#Blood_Donation_Machine "Machines"), [(Devil Beggar.png)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bindingofisaacre_gamepedia/images/b/b6/Devil_Beggar.png/revision/latest?cb=20210821101216) [Devil Beggar](/wiki/Beggar#Devil_Beggar "Beggar"), (Curse Room) [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room"), (Sacrifice Room) [Sacrifice Room](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room"), or self-damage Active Items) does not count as damage taken for Damocles, and will not give it the chance to fall.


Notes
-------


* The chance for the sword to fall does not increase beyond the first hit taken.
* In scenarios that have multiple items to choose from (such as rare double (Treasure Room) [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room") layouts and (Boss Rush) [Boss Rush](/wiki/Boss_Rush "Boss Rush")), an additional set of items for Isaac to choose from spawns. Only one item from each set can be taken.
* Having multiple Damocles active at once does not spawn additional items.
* The only way Isaac can survive the falling sword is if he's invincible at the time it falls or, by technicality, with a respawn item. After the sword falls, extra items will no longer spawn.
	+ Losing a life before the sword falls does not remove the sword or its threat.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns a wisp on the middle ring, looking like a sword. The wisp's tears look like [![image](/image/Spirit_Sword.png)](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword") [Spirit Sword](/wiki/Spirit_Sword "Spirit Sword")'s beams, but there are no other effects. Likely not fully implemented.


Interactions
--------------

* [(Butter!)](/wiki/Butter! "Butter!") [Butter!](/wiki/Butter! "Butter!"): Using active item will drop it and spawns an extra item pedestal on the ground; Getting hit may cause Isaac to drop the sword, removing the effect and chance of falling.

* [![image](/image/D4.png)](/wiki/D4 "D4") [D4](/wiki/D4 "D4") / [![image](/image/D100.png)](/wiki/D100 "D100") [D100](/wiki/D100 "D100") /  [(Tainted Eden)](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden") [Tainted Eden](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden"): The sword does not get rerolled.

* [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"): The sword will only gain the chance to fall if the brother who used it takes damage.
* [![image](/image/Kamikaze!.png)](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!") [Kamikaze!](/wiki/Kamikaze! "Kamikaze!"): Isaac blowing himself up *does* trigger the chance of falling.

* [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus"): The character that used Damocles must be active for double items to spawn.
	+ In the case of (Boss Room) [Boss Room](/wiki/Boss_Room "Boss Room"), the character that did not use Damocles must fight the boss for it to drop double items.
	+ If the player has [![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") and the inactive form has Damocles, the sword can fall on them and kill the player, bypassing the inactive form's immunity to damage.
* [(XVII - The Stars?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XVII - The Stars?") [XVII - The Stars?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"): The sword will not be removed from Isaac's inventory.

* [![image](/image/Dark_Arts.png)](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts") [Dark Arts](/wiki/Dark_Arts "Dark Arts"): When in the shadow state, Isaac can survive the instant kill of Damocles, though this requires precise timing and can be impossible if Dark Art's charge is empty as the sword is falling.

	+ [![image](/image/Tooth_and_Nail.png)](/wiki/Tooth_and_Nail "Tooth and Nail") [Tooth and Nail](/wiki/Tooth_and_Nail "Tooth and Nail")'s statue form can also save Isaac, but the statue transformation time lining up with the sword falling is unlikely.
* [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") /  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost"): Any damage the Lost would take is likely to kill him instantly, meaning that the item's downside is greatly mitigated.
