* The bird familiar spawned by this trinket is transparent and has one missing leg compared to the one spawned by the actual item.
* The familiar will not be cloned by (Added in Afterbirth)[(Box of Friends)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends")
* The familiar spawned can be sacrificed with [Sacrificial Altar](/wiki/Sacrificial_Altar "Sacrificial Altar"), destroying the trinket in the process
