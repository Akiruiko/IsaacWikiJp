Notes[]
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) The empty chest object that is left behind after opening any kind of chest can be re-rolled.
* On [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)") and [(Dark Room)](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room") [Dark Room](/wiki/Dark_Room "Dark Room"), the re-rolled chests will contain items.
* Cannot re-roll pickups into [Lil' Batteries](/wiki/Lil%27_Battery "Lil' Battery"), but can re-roll pickups into [Grab Bags](/wiki/Grab_Bag "Grab Bag") which can contain Lil' Batteries.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Can re-roll pickups into Lil' Batteries and other battery pickups.
* It can re-roll pickups into chests.
* It can re-roll pickups in the (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop").
* Re-rolling pickups duplicated by [(Rune of Jera)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Jera") [Rune of Jera](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), (Added in Afterbirth)[(Diplopia)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") and (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[(Crooked Penny)](/wiki/Crooked_Penny "Crooked Penny") [Crooked Penny](/wiki/Crooked_Penny "Crooked Penny") will result on both the original item and the duplicate being the exact same pickup.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Can re-roll both items created by [(Options?)](/wiki/Options%3F "Options?") [Options?](/wiki/Options%3F "Options?"), but only one can still be taken.
* (Added in Repentance) [Golden trinkets](/wiki/Golden_Trinket "Golden Trinket") rerolled by D20 will cause the resulting pickup to have the golden effect applied to it. If this is a trinket, the affected trinket will act as a normal golden trinket would, otherwise the gold effect will do nothing and will disappear upon leaving and reentering the room.
	+ Additionally, items spawned by chests with the gold effect applied will be golden as well, however other pickups dropped by chests will not be.
* (Added in Repentance) Can reroll coins dropped by  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") into other pickups, but they will still disappear if not picked up quickly.
