Effect
--------

	+ (Removed in Repentance) The familiar shoots once per second.
	+ (Added in Repentance) The familiar shoots once every 2/3rds of a second.

* (Removed in Repentance) ???'s Soul is unable to shoot while flying over obstacles (which is the same behavior that [(Ghost Baby)](/wiki/Ghost_Baby "Ghost Baby") [Ghost Baby](/wiki/Ghost_Baby "Ghost Baby") has).
