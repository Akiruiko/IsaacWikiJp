 # Buddy in a Box ![image](/image/Buddy_in_a_Box.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants a familiar with random tear effects, fire rate, and damage.
	+ The familiar's damage scales from ~2-6, and tear delay scales from ~12-30.
	+ The familiar takes the appearance of a random [co-op baby](/wiki/Co-op "Co-op").
	+ The familiar is randomized upon entering a new [floor](/wiki/Floor "Floor").
* (Added in Repentance) This item belongs to the [Conjoined](/wiki/Conjoined "Conjoined") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a three-faced version of himself.


Notes
-------


* The tear effects available are the same as on the [![image](/image/Fruit_Cake.png)](/wiki/Fruit_Cake "Fruit Cake") [Fruit Cake](/wiki/Fruit_Cake "Fruit Cake") item.
* The familiar's tear appearance isn't linked to the normal effect such tears would have.
	+ For instance, [piercing](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears")-looking tears might not go through enemies and [![image](/image/Sinus_Infection.png)](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") [Sinus Infection](/wiki/Sinus_Infection "Sinus Infection") tears might not stick, while tears that do not look like [![image](/image/Compound_Fracture.png)](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") [Compound Fracture](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") tears can still split on hit.
* Some tear effects like [![image](/image/Proptosis.png)](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") [Proptosis](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") and [![image](/image/Tiny_Planet.png)](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") [Tiny Planet](/wiki/Tiny_Planet "Tiny Planet") do not have their associated stat boosts and thus are very ineffective.
* Familiars with the [![image](/image/Serpent%27s_Kiss.png)](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") [Serpent's Kiss](/wiki/Serpent%27s_Kiss "Serpent's Kiss") effect can drop [(Black Heart)](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart") [Black Hearts](/wiki/Black_Heart "Black Heart") when an enemy is killed.
* Familiars will not do contact damage.
* (Added in Repentance) The familiar will change upon exiting the (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Knife_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") area. (possibly a bug)
