 # The Battery ![image](/image/The_Battery.png) 


Effects
---------


* +0.7 [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears")
* Significantly shrinks Isaac, allowing him to squeeze between objects and makes some enemy shots pass over him.


Notes
-------


* With enough speed and the correct angle or being pushed by an explosion, it is possible to cross pits and pass through obstacles, allowing Isaac to reach places he usually isn't able to reach.
* May allow Isaac to squeeze through the walls and floors in [Crawl Spaces](/wiki/Crawl_Space "Crawl Space"). Passing through the outermost wall in an unintended direction leads to the [I AM ERROR](/wiki/I_AM_ERROR "I AM ERROR") room.
* The decrease in size makes dodging certain tear effects easier, most notably [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush")'s continuum tears, and [Dogma](/wiki/Dogma "Dogma")'s feather attacks from their respective second phases.


Interactions
--------------
