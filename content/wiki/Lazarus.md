When Lazarus (or another character with the item [![image](/image/Lazarus%27_Rags.png)](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags") [Lazarus' Rags](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags")) dies, they will be resurrected in the same room as *Lazarus Risen*.

Lazarus Risen gains a significant increase to most of his stats, with bonuses in Damage, Speed, Range, and Luck, as well as the [![image](/image/Anemic.png)](/wiki/Anemic "Anemic") [Anemic](/wiki/Anemic "Anemic") passive item, causing him to leave a toxic blood trail behind him after taking damage. Note that unlike most [other items that cause the player to respawn](/wiki/Death#Extra_Lives "Death"), Lazarus' revival ability revives him on the spot, as opposed to the previous safe room.

Lazarus Risen is considered by the game to be a separate character from Lazarus, but all unlockable items can be earned by completing objectives with Lazarus Risen, and if you beat particular bosses for the first time with Lazarus Risen, you will gain the corresponding [Completion Mark](/wiki/Completion_Mark "Completion Mark") on Lazarus's post-it note.

(Added in Afterbirth †) After Challenge 31: [Backasswards](/wiki/Backasswards "Backasswards") is beaten, Lazarus Risen's Anemic effect is permanent and no longer requires him to take damage.


ノート
-------


* Resurrection items (ability, in this case) activate in a [set order](/wiki/Category:Revival_items "Category:Revival items"). Lazarus' inherent extra life is (Removed in Repentance) 2nd / (Added in Repentance) 3rd in this order after (Added in Repentance)[(Soul of Lazarus)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Soul of Lazarus") [Soul of Lazarus](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") and [![image](/image/1up!.png)](/wiki/1up! "1up!") [1up!](/wiki/1up! "1up!").
* Lazarus' negative luck decreases the chance to obtain Room Drops. As such, items increasing Luck are welcomed.
* Lazarus' low range can make it harder to hit enemies, in such case, items increasing Range are also welcomed.
* It is also possible to let yourself purposefully die at the beginning to become Lazarus Risen and obtain stronger stats, although you will be revived on the spot and have only 1 heart container.
	+ For example, attempt to complete the 2nd floor without any red heart damage, enter the [Devil room](/wiki/Devil_room "Devil room"), and make deals until Lazarus dies. This will utilize Lazarus's 3 red heart containers to the most if successfully performed but heavily relies on RNG.
* (Added in Afterbirth †) After beating Challenge 31: [Backasswards](/wiki/Backasswards "Backasswards"), Lazarus will have [![image](/image/Anemic.png)](/wiki/Anemic "Anemic") [Anemic](/wiki/Anemic "Anemic") even before reviving. Anemic gives +5 range which compensates his shortness on the range, effectively nullifying problems around this.
	+ Lazarus Risen will always have Anemic activated and will constantly leave blood trails. A higher Speed attribute may help him spread more blood around the room.
* Donating your last heart piece to a devil beggar and respawning as Lazarus Risen activates the beggar an extra two times for a total of three.


アイテム効果
-------------------

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright"): Lazarus gains nothing directly from Birthright. Dying and becoming Lazarus Risen, or picking up Birthright when already in that form grants a slowly fading +21.6 damage bonus.


### Good Items


* Any range up items. ([![image](/image/Mom%27s_Heels.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heels "Mom's Heels") [Mom's Heels](/wiki/Mom%27s_Heels "Mom's Heels"), [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Underwear.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Underwear "Mom's Underwear") [Mom's Underwear](/wiki/Mom%27s_Underwear "Mom's Underwear")...)
* (Removed in Repentance) The lack of range can be compensated by a higher shot speed, via picking up items such as [![image](/image/Cat-O-Nine-Tails.png)](/wiki/Cat-O-Nine-Tails "Cat-O-Nine-Tails") [Cat-O-Nine-Tails](/wiki/Cat-O-Nine-Tails "Cat-O-Nine-Tails") or [![image](/image/Speed_Ball.png)](/wiki/Speed_Ball "Speed Ball") [Speed Ball](/wiki/Speed_Ball "Speed Ball").
* Any luck up items. ([![image](/image/Latch_Key.png)](/wiki/Latch_Key "Latch Key") [Latch Key](/wiki/Latch_Key "Latch Key"), [![image](/image/Lucky_Foot.png)](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot") [Lucky Foot](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot")...)
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Lost Cork)](/wiki/Lost_Cork "Lost Cork") [Lost Cork](/wiki/Lost_Cork "Lost Cork") increases the size of Anemic's creep trail, which can be useful for Lazarus Risen, especially if he has the Anemic effect permanently due to the player having beaten [Backasswards](/wiki/Backasswards "Backasswards").
* [![image](/image/PHD.png)](/wiki/PHD "PHD") [PHD](/wiki/PHD "PHD"), [![image](/image/Virgo.png)](/wiki/Virgo "Virgo") [Virgo](/wiki/Virgo "Virgo") or (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Lucky_Foot.png)](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot") [Lucky Foot](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot") can turn Lazarus' beginning pill into a positive one unless his pill has an effect deemed neutral.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Plan_C.png)](/wiki/Plan_C "Plan C") [Plan C](/wiki/Plan_C "Plan C") safer to use due to inherent extra life.
* [(Suicide King)](/wiki/Suicide_King "Suicide King") [Suicide King](/wiki/Suicide_King "Suicide King") can be used most effectively when playing as Lazarus.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Damocles.png)](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles") [Damocles](/wiki/Damocles "Damocles") is less dangerous than for most of the characters as Lazarus already starts with an extra life.
* After his resurrection, any health up items will help. Lazarus Risen initially has only 1 heart, therefore he is rather fragile.


### Bad Items


* [![image](/image/Cricket%27s_Body.png)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") *Can* be detrimental. Although it allows an increase in Tears and gives splash tears, its range diminution, added with Lazarus' already low range, can become dangerous. The same applies to [![image](/image/Number_One.png)](/wiki/Number_One "Number One") [Number One](/wiki/Number_One "Number One").
* (Removed in Repentance)[![image](/image/Eve%27s_Mascara.png)](/wiki/Eve%27s_Mascara "Eve's Mascara") [Eve's Mascara](/wiki/Eve%27s_Mascara "Eve's Mascara") and [![image](/image/Dead_Onion.png)](/wiki/Dead_Onion "Dead Onion") [Dead Onion](/wiki/Dead_Onion "Dead Onion")'s drastic shot speed reduction can also prove themselves to be negative for Lazarus.
* [![image](/image/A_Lump_of_Coal.png)](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") [A Lump of Coal](/wiki/A_Lump_of_Coal "A Lump of Coal") loses efficiency due to Lazarus' initial range.


Note that after his resurrection, or (Added in Afterbirth †) receiving Anemic for the first life, these problems become much less troublesome due to the increased Range stat. 



* Be careful when using self-damaging items or taking devil deals as Lazarus Risen, as his shortness on heart containers could prove fatal.
