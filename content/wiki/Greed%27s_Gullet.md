Effects[]
---------


* Grants an extra Red [Heart container](/wiki/Heart_container "Heart container") for every 25 [coins](/wiki/Coins "Coins") Isaac has, up to a maximum of 4 hearts at 99 coins.
	+ Dropping below the number of coins required for a Red Heart container removes the Red Heart container.


Notes[]
-------


* The extra Red Heart container can exceed the maximum Coin Heart container limit of  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper"), allowing him to obtain more than (Removed in Repentance)2 / (Added in Repentance)3 Coin Heart containers.
* Depending on the character used, this item only affects Red Heart containers, Soul Hearts ( [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)")) or Coin Heart containers (Keeper). It does not affect  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost").
* (Removed in Repentance) The Red Heart container gain is not retroactive - picking it up at 99 coins will not grant 4 extra Red Heart containers.
	+ However, picking it up at 99 coins and then dropping below 99 coins will lose a Red Heart container, decreasing the feasibility of picking this item up the more coins you have.
		- The player will die if they lose their last form of health as a result of Greed's Gullet.
		- If Keeper drops to under 2 Coin Heart containers as a result of Greed's Gullet, or by any other means (Devil deal, etc.), he is unable to use an HP Up to increase his health back to 2 and has to regain the lost coins to do so.
	+ If Greed's Gullet is rerolled away after gaining health, the extra health will be preserved even if the player loses the coins afterward.
		- However, if this happens with Keeper, his health will drop back to 2 Coin Heart containers upon picking up an item, unless another Greed's Gullet is picked up.
* (Added in Repentance) The Red Heart containers granted by Greed's Gullet are now retroactive - picking the item up at 99 coins will immediately grant 4 Red Heart containers. Consuming coins will still cause Isaac to lose Red Heart containers.
* (Added in Repentance) This also applies in reverse; consuming Red Heart containers granted by Greed's Gullet through methods such as [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") items or [(Guppy's Paw)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") [Guppy's Paw](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Paw "Guppy's Paw") will cause Isaac to lose an appropriate amount of coins.
* (Added in Repentance) For  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") specifically, Greed's Gullet in combination with [(Deep Pockets)](/wiki/Deep_Pockets "Deep Pockets") [Deep Pockets](/wiki/Deep_Pockets "Deep Pockets") allows him to bypass the 12 heart container health limit, capping at 15 Coin Hearts at 999 coins. However, additional heart containers beyond 12 will not appear on the health bar.
	+ Works the same for  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") but caps at 14 Coin Hearts instead.
* Be careful when buying items from the [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop"), as it can remove Red Heart containers.
* Enemies that drain Isaac's coins (such as [Keepers](/wiki/Keeper_(Enemy) "Keeper (Enemy)"), [Hangers](/wiki/Hanger "Hanger"), [Greed](/wiki/Greed "Greed"), or [Super Greed](/wiki/Super_Greed "Super Greed")) can remove Red Heart containers.
* This item allows  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") to use health up pills, the Coin Hearts gained this way are kept even if you lose coins, and can bypass the limit at 99 coins


Synergies[]
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[(Deep Pockets)](/wiki/Deep_Pockets "Deep Pockets") [Deep Pockets](/wiki/Deep_Pockets "Deep Pockets"): After exceeding 100 coins, Isaac gains an extra heart container for every 100 coins instead of every 25.
* [(Money = Power)](/wiki/Money_%3D_Power "Money = Power") [Money = Power](/wiki/Money_%3D_Power "Money = Power"): Isaac will gain both damage and health.
* Not only can [Strawman](/wiki/Strawman "Strawman") benefit from Greed's Gullet's extra coin hearts, he doesn't lose them upon going down a 25 coin interval (unless you quit out and then continue the run).


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(A Dollar)](/wiki/A_Dollar "A Dollar") [A Dollar](/wiki/A_Dollar "A Dollar"): Isaac will instantly gain the max amount of Red Heart containers.
* [(Eye of Greed)](/wiki/Eye_of_Greed "Eye of Greed") [Eye of Greed](/wiki/Eye_of_Greed "Eye of Greed"): Coins will be lost for every 20th tear fired, risking Red Heart container loss if Isaac has more than 24 coins.
* [(A Quarter)](/wiki/A_Quarter "A Quarter") [A Quarter](/wiki/A_Quarter "A Quarter"): Isaac will gain a Red Heart container.
