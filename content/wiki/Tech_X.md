Effects[]
---------


* Isaac's tears are replaced with ring-shaped lasers.
	+ Shots can be charged to increase the size of the rings.
	+ Only the outer circumference of the rings will deal damage.
	+ Rings pass through obstacles and enemies.
	+ Rings have infinite range and will travel until they hit a wall.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Damage dealt is based on the amount charged, starting at 25% Isaac's damage and scaling to 100% at maximum charge.
		- The numbers above occur with very high tear delay. A high tears stat can increase the minimum damage dealt, but decreases the maximum damage dealt.
			* At 30.00 fire rate or above (0 tear delay or lower), charging is no longer needed. Higher fire rate results in higher laser damage. At 120.00 fire rate, rings deal 100% Isaac's damage per tick.


Notes[]
-------


* The rings are similar in appearance to the combination of [(The Ludovico Technique)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") and [(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology").
* The laser rings will linger for a brief moment upon touching a wall, allowing more damage to be dealt to enemies closer to walls.
* The "R U A WIZARD?" pill effect does not work with Tech X.
* (Removed in Repentance) Charging only increases size, not damage. It is useful for hard-to-hit enemies or hitting a wide area at once, but spamming small, uncharged shots will lead to much higher damage output.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) With the charge bars option enabled, the rings can be released immediately as the charge bar appears for easier gauging of maximum damage output.
* (Added in Repentance) The maximum ring size is slightly smaller in *Repentance*.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(20/20)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20"): Fires two Tech X rings instead of one.
* [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Fires a brimstone ring. This brimstone ring is larger than the laser ring and has a much wider hitbox.
	+ [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel"): Picking up Brimstone will still override Tech X. When you pick up Tech X as Azazel with his inherited Brimstone, Tech X does nothing at all.
		- (Added in Afterbirth †) As Azazel, Brimstone no longer overrides Tech X, instead Tech X overrides Azazel's Brimstone. This works quite well with Azazel's good initial damage stat and also negates his initial range penalty.
		- (Added in Repentance)Azazel fires a Brimstone ring instead of Tech X ring.
			* The same applies to  [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel").
	+ (Removed in Repentance)[(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") + [(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"): The damage boost from Brimstone+Technology is lost, but the laser fires while charging the brimstone ring.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Double [(Brimstone)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Increases the width of the beam giving it an even larger hitbox.

* (Added in Repentance)[(C Section)](/wiki/C_Section "C Section") [C Section](/wiki/C_Section "C Section"): Overrides the charging effect, but shoots a laser ring with a fetus tear in the middle.
* [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Overrides the charging effect, but shoots a laser ring with a bomb in the middle.
* [(Epic Fetus)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus"): Each missile shoots 10 laser beams like from [(Technology)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology") in each direction, similar to Tammy's Head.

* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Haemolacria)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): Haemolacria tears will burst into 3-5 Tech X rings on impact.

* (Added in Repentance)[(Mucormycosis)](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis") [Mucormycosis](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis"): Hitting enemies has a chance to stick a spore to them.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Rubber Cement)](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement") [Rubber Cement](/wiki/Rubber_Cement "Rubber Cement"): The rings bounce off walls once and have infinite range.
* [(Spoon Bender)](/wiki/Spoon_Bender "Spoon Bender") [Spoon Bender](/wiki/Spoon_Bender "Spoon Bender"): While the rings won't home in on enemies, they will bend inwards to hit enemies within each ring, resulting in a substantial damage area increase.
* [(Strange Attractor)](/wiki/Strange_Attractor "Strange Attractor") [Strange Attractor](/wiki/Strange_Attractor "Strange Attractor"): Magnetic effect pulls pickups and objects to the edge of the ring, increasing accuracy.
* [(Tech.5)](/wiki/Tech.5 "Tech.5") [Tech.5](/wiki/Tech.5 "Tech.5"): Occasionally fires a linear laser while charging Tech X.

Bugs[]
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | (Removed in Afterbirth †) The black ring generated from the synergy of [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") and Tech X behaves as a [Maw of the Void](/wiki/Maw_of_the_Void "Maw of the Void") ring and may cause black hearts to drop. |




| (Bug) Bug!
 | Having Tech X with [(Soy Milk)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") / (Added in Repentance)[(Almond Milk)](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk") [Almond Milk](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk") and [(Kidney Stone)](/wiki/Kidney_Stone "Kidney Stone") [Kidney Stone](/wiki/Kidney_Stone "Kidney Stone") causes Isaac unable to fire laser rings when Kidney Stone is active.
