 # Tech X ![image](/image/Tech_X.png) 


Effects
---------


* Isaac's tears are replaced with ring-shaped lasers.
	+ Shots can be charged to increase the size of the rings.
	+ Only the outer circumference of the rings will deal damage.
	+ Rings pass through obstacles and enemies.
	+ Rings have infinite range and will travel until they hit a wall.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Damage dealt is based on the amount charged, starting at 25% Isaac's damage and scaling to 100% at maximum charge.
		- The numbers above occur with very high tear delay. A high tears stat can increase the minimum damage dealt, but decreases the maximum damage dealt.
			* At 30.00 fire rate or above (0 tear delay or lower), charging is no longer needed. Higher fire rate results in higher laser damage. At 120.00 fire rate, rings deal 100% Isaac's damage per tick.


Notes
-------


* The rings are similar in appearance to the combination of [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") and [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology").
* The laser rings will linger for a brief moment upon touching a wall, allowing more damage to be dealt to enemies closer to walls.
* The "R U A WIZARD?" pill effect does not work with Tech X.
* (Removed in Repentance) Charging only increases size, not damage. It is useful for hard-to-hit enemies or hitting a wide area at once, but spamming small, uncharged shots will lead to much higher damage output.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth † / Removed in Repentance) With the charge bars option enabled, the rings can be released immediately as the charge bar appears for easier gauging of maximum damage output.
* (Added in Repentance) The maximum ring size is slightly smaller in *Repentance*.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/20/20.png)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20"): Fires two Tech X rings instead of one.
* [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Fires a brimstone ring. This brimstone ring is larger than the laser ring and has a much wider hitbox.
	+ [(Azazel)](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel") [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel "Azazel"): Picking up Brimstone will still override Tech X. When you pick up Tech X as Azazel with his inherited Brimstone, Tech X does nothing at all.
		- (Added in Afterbirth †) As Azazel, Brimstone no longer overrides Tech X, instead Tech X overrides Azazel's Brimstone. This works quite well with Azazel's good initial damage stat and also negates his initial range penalty.
		- (Added in Repentance)Azazel fires a Brimstone ring instead of Tech X ring.
			* The same applies to  [(Tainted Azazel)](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel") [Tainted Azazel](/wiki/Tainted_Azazel "Tainted Azazel").

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Mucormycosis.png)](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis") [Mucormycosis](/wiki/Mucormycosis "Mucormycosis"): Hitting enemies has a chance to stick a spore to them.

| (Bug) Bug!
 | (Removed in Afterbirth †) The black ring generated from the synergy of [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") and Tech X behaves as a [Maw of the Void](/wiki/Maw_of_the_Void "Maw of the Void") ring and may cause black hearts to drop. |
