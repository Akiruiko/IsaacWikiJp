 # The Pinking Shears ![image](/image/The_Pinking_Shears.png) 

Effects
---------


* Separates Isaac's head and body for the current [room](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms"). Isaac's head, which now has [flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight"), will be under the player's control, while his body will seek out enemies to attack by contact damage.
	+ The body's movement speed is dependent on Isaac's [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed").
	+ The body deals 5.5 damage per tick, or up to 82.5 damage per second.
		- (Added in Repentance) The damage tick rate of the body has been reduced.


Notes
-------


* The damage of the body [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") is independent of Isaac's stats. Its damage per second is the highest of all chasing familiars.
* (Added in Repentance) If Isaac's body is not visible (for example, through the effects of [![image](/image/Transcendence.png)](/wiki/Transcendence "Transcendence") [Transcendence](/wiki/Transcendence "Transcendence") or previous uses of the Pinking Shears), the familiar will take upon a ghost-like body, similar to the Lost's body type.
* If used multiple times in the same room (via battery pickups, for example), more instances of the body familiar can be spawned.
* Compared to the original game, where the [Gusher](/wiki/Gusher "Gusher") sometimes walked aimlessly around the room, this version actively chases enemies.
* If Isaac switches active items while The Pinking Shears is in effect, the body will immediately despawn for the rest of the room.
* The body familiar will avoid [creep](/wiki/Creep "Creep"), and will consequently rarely damage enemies like [Brains](/wiki/Brain "Brain") and [Blighted Ovum](/wiki/Blighted_Ovum "Blighted Ovum") that leave creep trails as they walk, instead opting to stand right next to them.
* Using The Pinking Shears just above an obstacle results in the body becoming stuck in the terrain, making it useless until the obstacle is destroyed.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Damage dealt by the body is doubled.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns wisps on the inner ring, looking like Isaac's floating head. Wisps fire [piercing](/wiki/Tear_Effects "Tear Effects") tears.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Two bodies are spawned at once.
* (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"): Only the head needs to be moved by the  [(Tainted Soul)](/wiki/Tainted_Soul "Tainted Soul") [Tainted Soul](/wiki/Tainted_Soul "Tainted Soul").


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Guillotine.png)](/wiki/Guillotine "Guillotine") [Guillotine](/wiki/Guillotine "Guillotine"): Using The Pinking Shears after picking up Guillotine results in the head revolving around a shadow, making Isaac's hitbox difficult to determine.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/The_Intruder.png)](/wiki/The_Intruder "The Intruder") [The Intruder](/wiki/The_Intruder "The Intruder"): If the familiar is released after Pinking Shears are used, control is given back to an invisible head with only a shadow visible. This is due to both the head (the spider) and the body being mobilized to attack.
