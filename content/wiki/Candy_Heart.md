Notes[]
-------


* Items/effects that directly heal Isaac (such as [(Yum Heart)](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart") [Yum Heart](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart"), [(XIX - The Sun)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XIX - The Sun") [XIX - The Sun](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), [(Charm of the Vampire)](/wiki/Charm_of_the_Vampire "Charm of the Vampire") [Charm of the Vampire](/wiki/Charm_of_the_Vampire "Charm of the Vampire"), etc.) do not trigger stat boosts from Candy Heart.
* Healing using [Rotten Hearts](/wiki/Rotten_Heart "Rotten Heart") triggers the stat boosts for Candy Heart.
* This item does not give stats when adding to  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany")'s blood charges.
* This item is useless for  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") and  [(Tainted Lost)](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost") [Tainted Lost](/wiki/Tainted_Lost "Tainted Lost"), since they don't have health.
* This item is useless for  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") and  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper"), since they can't encounter red hearts.
* This item is useless for characters such as [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas"),  [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)") ,  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") ect, since they can't get red heart containers.
* Any healing prior to picking up Candy Heart will not provide stat boosts.
* The stat bonuses are "stored" on the Candy Heart. Dropping or losing it in any way won't immediately revert the bonuses gained, only when Isaac's stats are updated again. The respective stat changed is the one that loses the Candy Heart bonuses.
	+ The bonus stats will be lost if Isaac's stats are updated by dropping out of the game or if the game crashes.
* The stat bonuses are [seeded](/wiki/Seed "Seed"), meaning the same stat ups will apply in the same order in the same seed.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Hypercoagulation)](/wiki/Hypercoagulation "Hypercoagulation") [Hypercoagulation](/wiki/Hypercoagulation "Hypercoagulation"):/ [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene"): Can provide infinite stat boosts, if the dropped hearts are caught in time.
* [(Maggy's Bow)](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Bow "Maggy's Bow") [Maggy's Bow](/wiki/Maggy%27s_Bow "Maggy's Bow"): Increases the stat boosts given by Candy Heart, provided extra Red health was restored.


Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Apple of Sodom)](/wiki/Apple_of_Sodom "Apple of Sodom") [Apple of Sodom](/wiki/Apple_of_Sodom "Apple of Sodom"): This doesn't give the stat increases when picking up hearts to make spiders.
* [(Diplopia)](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia") [Diplopia](/wiki/Diplopia "Diplopia"): This item isn't affected by stacking.
