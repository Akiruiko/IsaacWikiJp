 # Milk! ![image](/image/Milk!.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns a glass [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that follows Isaac and spills on the floor upon taking damage.
* When the milk spills, Isaac receives -2 [tear delay](/wiki/Attributes#Tear_Delay "Attributes") ((Added in Repentance) +1) (increased rate of fire) until leaving the [room](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms").
	+ Direct tear delay reduction can take Isaac's tears stat below the normal soft cap of 5.
* The milk puddle is purely visual, and will stay on the ground for a few seconds before disappearing. The familiar will reappear in the next room.
