Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Dr._Fetus.png)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Increases tear delay, and after the first bomb explodes, a second bomb appears where the first one exploded, doing roughly half the damage of the first.
* [![image](/image/The_Inner_Eye.png)](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") [The Inner Eye](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye")/[![image](/image/Mutant_Spider.png)](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") [Mutant Spider](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider"): The tear rate is not lowered further, but the effect on damage becomes a flat +5 bonus instead.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): The Forgotten's bone club becomes massive. It deals very high damage but has a very low swing rate.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Rock_Bottom.png)](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom") [Rock Bottom](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom"): Allows Isaac to keep his previous fire rate in addition to the massive damage boost.
* (Added in Repentance) [![image](/image/Shard_of_Glass.png)](/wiki/Shard_of_Glass "Shard of Glass") [Shard of Glass](/wiki/Shard_of_Glass "Shard of Glass"): The rapidly spawning red tears do full damage.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Haemolacria.png)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): The main tear retains the semi-piercing ability and may not burst when hitting a weaker enemy. Split tears do not semi-pierce.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Lachryphagy.png)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Greatly increases how big the fed tear can grow.
* [![image](/image/Lost_Contact.png)](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact") [Lost Contact](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact"): Isaac's tears will block enemy shots and continue, but lose 10 damage. If the tear had less than 10 damage left, it disappears.
* [Piercing tears](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears"): Semi-piercing is replaced by proper piercing, with no loss of damage on any enemy contact.
* [![image](/image/Polyphemus.png)](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") Polyphemus: No further effect when multiple copies are acquired.
