Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Dr. Fetus)](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus") [Dr. Fetus](/wiki/Dr._Fetus "Dr. Fetus"): Increases tear delay, and after the first bomb explodes, a second bomb appears where the first one exploded, doing roughly half the damage of the first.
* [(The Inner Eye)](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye") [The Inner Eye](/wiki/The_Inner_Eye "The Inner Eye")/[(Mutant Spider)](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider") [Mutant Spider](/wiki/Mutant_Spider "Mutant Spider"): The tear rate is not lowered further, but the effect on damage becomes a flat +5 bonus instead.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"): The Forgotten's bone club becomes massive. It deals very high damage but has a very low swing rate.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Rock Bottom)](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom") [Rock Bottom](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom"): Allows Isaac to keep his previous fire rate in addition to the massive damage boost.

Interactions[]
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Haemolacria)](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria") [Haemolacria](/wiki/Haemolacria "Haemolacria"): The main tear retains the semi-piercing ability and may not burst when hitting a weaker enemy. Split tears do not semi-pierce.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Lachryphagy)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Greatly increases how big the fed tear can grow.
* [(Lost Contact)](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact") [Lost Contact](/wiki/Lost_Contact "Lost Contact"): Isaac's tears will block enemy shots and continue, but lose 10 damage. If the tear had less than 10 damage left, it disappears.
* [Piercing tears](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears"): Semi-piercing is replaced by proper piercing, with no loss of damage on any enemy contact.
* [(Polyphemus)](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") Polyphemus: No further effect when multiple copies are acquired.
