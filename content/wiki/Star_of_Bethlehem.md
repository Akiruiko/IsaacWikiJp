 # Star of Bethlehem ![image](/image/Star_of_Bethlehem.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns a star [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that slowly travels toward the boss room, fading through doors as it travels towards it. Once it reaches the boss room, the familiar stands in the center of the boss room for the rest of the floor.
* The familiar emits an aura that, while Isaac stands inside it, gives him +1 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage"), a 1.2x damage multiplier, a 0.4x [tear delay](/wiki/Tear_delay "Tear delay") multiplier, and [homing tears](/wiki/Tear_Effects#Homing "Tear Effects"). It also gives Isaac a chance to block damage similar to [![image](/image/Cone_Head.png)](/wiki/Cone_Head "Cone Head") [Cone Head](/wiki/Cone_Head "Cone Head").


Notes
-------


* In [(The Void)](/wiki/The_Void "The Void") [The Void](/wiki/The_Void "The Void"), the familiar will travel to the boss room that contains [Delirium](/wiki/Delirium "Delirium").
* In [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)"), the familiar will stay in the first room and will not travel to [Hush](/wiki/Hush "Hush"), rendering it useless.
* In [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode"), the star will travel directly to the position where Isaac spawns upon entering a new floor.
	+ On the last floor, it will move to the upper part of [Ultra Greed](/wiki/Ultra_Greed "Ultra Greed")'s room.
* Once the star settles down in the boss room, the damage preventing aura can be used to play [Blood Donation Machines](/wiki/Machines "Machines") and [Devil Beggars](/wiki/Devil_Beggar_(Item_Pool) "Devil Beggar (Item Pool)") for free, provided they are spawned via [(XIV - Temperance)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XIV - Temperance") [XIV - Temperance](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") or [(XX - Judgement)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XX - Judgement") [XX - Judgement](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") cards, respectively.
* The star may travel through [secret rooms](/wiki/Secret_room "Secret room") and [curse rooms](/wiki/Curse_room "Curse room") on its path to the boss room.
* The star will travel to the boss room to [Mother](/wiki/Mother "Mother"), but it will not be present during the fight.
* During the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent"), the star will linger in the boss room of each floor, and will not progress backwards through the stage.
* The star will not appear in the fight with [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") or [Mega Satan](/wiki/Mega_Satan "Mega Satan").
* For  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"), the bonuses from the star are only applied if Tainted Forgotten is within its aura, not  [(Tainted Soul)](/wiki/Tainted_Soul "Tainted Soul") [Tainted Soul](/wiki/Tainted_Soul "Tainted Soul").
* If either  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") or  [(Dead Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus") [Dead Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus") have picked up the star, the familiar will spawn in the same room the flip to its owner occurs, instead of continuing where it had previously left off. So flipping before or inside the boss room could be a viable way to guarantee the bonus during the fight, quite possibly in a faster manner as well since the star won't have to move through the entire floor.
* During the [Backasswards](/wiki/Backasswards "Backasswards") Challenge, the star acts as usual; originating in the starting room and gradually moving towards the boss room.
* The star will be copied in the [Mirrored World](/wiki/Mirrored_World "Mirrored World") and will simultaneously travel in both worlds.
* Entering and leaving the [![image](/image/Knife_Piece_2.png)](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") [Knife Piece 2](/wiki/Knife_Piece_2 "Knife Piece 2") area will reset the star and make it reappear in the room with the minecart.
