 # Flat Stone ![image](/image/Flat_Stone.png) 


Effects
---------


* Upon use, Isaac farts, knocking back enemies and their shots. It also sends out rock waves that deal 10 damage per tick to nearby enemies and break [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacle "Obstacle").


Notes
-------


* This item is identical to [![image](/image/Butter_Bean.png)](/wiki/Butter_Bean "Butter Bean") [Butter Bean](/wiki/Butter_Bean "Butter Bean") in appearance.
* (Removed in Repentance) [![image](/image/Butter_Bean.png)](/wiki/Butter_Bean "Butter Bean") [Butter Bean](/wiki/Butter_Bean "Butter Bean") has a small chance to turn into this item upon pickup.
* (Added in Repentance) Each run as a chance of replacing Butter Bean with Wait What? in item pools. Both items generally do not exist during the same run.
* This item is useful for opening [Secret Rooms](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room"), [Super Secret Rooms](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room"), and [Bedrooms](/wiki/Bedroom "Bedroom"). In Bedrooms, it can also open up the passage under the carpet.
	+ To break open a secret room, the wall must be hit with one of the rock waves, not the gas cloud, so Isaac needs to stand a few steps away from the wall.
* The earthquake can open [Bomb Chests](/wiki/Bomb_Chest "Bomb Chest").
* (Removed in Repentance) The earthquake can be used to blow up the [Donation Machine](/wiki/Donation_Machine "Donation Machine") or activate/blow up a [Restock Box](/wiki/Restock_Box "Restock Box").


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns white-glowing wisps on the middle ring that don't shoot. The wisps invoke the effect of Wait What? when destroyed and do not persist between rooms.
* [![image](/image/Ghost_Pepper.png)](/wiki/Ghost_Pepper "Ghost Pepper") [Ghost Pepper](/wiki/Ghost_Pepper "Ghost Pepper"): Shoots a flame behind Isaac upon each use of Wait What. While [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") does not duplicate Wait What's shockwave, the flame shot is duplicated regardless.
