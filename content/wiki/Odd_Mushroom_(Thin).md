	+ (Added in Repentance) Each fire deals up to 4 ticks of damage: 1st tick deals 23 damage, 2nd tick 17.3 damage, and 3rd and 4th tick 11.5 damage.
		- (Added in Repentance) Fires can block projectiles, up to 4 times, each time getting smaller.

* (Added in Afterbirth) Isaac gives a wide glow lighting up dark areas, such as those under the effects of the Curse of Darkness or the [Dark One](/wiki/Dark_One "Dark One")'s attacks.


Notes
-------


* The explosion effect chance depends on the [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck") stat, and goes up to 100% at 13 luck.
* An exploding tear does not set either the hit enemy or anything in the blast range on fire.
* Explosive and burning damage is equal to Isaac's current damage stat.
* The flame will transform [Hoppers](/wiki/Hopper "Hopper") into [Flaming Hoppers](/wiki/Flaming_Hopper "Flaming Hopper").
