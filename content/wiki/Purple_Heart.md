 # Purple Heart ![image](/image/Purple_Heart.png) 

Effects
---------


* Doubles the chance for [champion enemies](/wiki/Monsters#Champions "Monsters") to appear.
* Also increases the chance of encountering champion [bosses](/wiki/Boss "Boss").


Notes
-------


* The increased number of Champions means that more enemies will drop additional loot, making this great when low on Keys or bombs.
* The chance to spawn a champion in Normal is very low and the drop chance for additional loot in Hard mode is only 33% making this item fairly weak overall.
* (Added in Afterbirth) Since champions don't drop any consumables in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode"), this trinket only has a downside in this mode.
