Notes[]
-------


* Clicker can only transform Isaac into characters that have already been unlocked, along with  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") and  [(Lazarus Risen)](/wiki/Lazarus_Risen "Lazarus Risen") [Lazarus Risen](/wiki/Lazarus_Risen "Lazarus Risen"), who are counted as separate from  [(Judas)](/wiki/Judas "Judas") [Judas](/wiki/Judas "Judas") and  [(Lazarus)](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus") [Lazarus](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus") respectively.  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") and  [(The Soul)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)"), (Added in Repentance)  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"),(Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") [Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Tainted_Lazarus "Tainted Lazarus") and (Added in Repentance)  [(Dead Tainted Lazarus)](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus") [Dead Tainted Lazarus](/wiki/Dead_Tainted_Lazarus "Dead Tainted Lazarus"), and (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") and (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Soul)](/wiki/Tainted_Soul "Tainted Soul") [Tainted Soul](/wiki/Tainted_Soul "Tainted Soul") are all counted as inherently linked dual-characters.
* (Added in Repentance) Non-tainted characters can only transform into other non-tainted characters, and tainted characters can only transform into other tainted characters.
* It is possible for the Clicker to choose the same character as the one that is already being played as, making it seem like the item created no effect at all.
* Transforming into a new character does not grant Isaac the starting items of the new character unless they are inherent to the character. For example, transforming into  [(Cain)](/wiki/Cain "Cain") [Cain](/wiki/Cain "Cain") does not grant [(Lucky Foot)](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot") [Lucky Foot](/wiki/Lucky_Foot "Lucky Foot").
* Health is conserved between characters.
	+ All [Red Heart containers](/wiki/Red_Heart_container "Red Heart container") will be lost, and all bone heart containers will be emptied when changing into  [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)"), (Added in Repentance)  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas"), (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted ???)](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???") [Tainted ???](/wiki/Tainted_%3F%3F%3F "Tainted ???"), (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Judas)](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") [Tainted Judas](/wiki/Tainted_Judas "Tainted Judas") or (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Forgotten)](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten") [Tainted Forgotten](/wiki/Tainted_Forgotten "Tainted Forgotten"). They will gain a half Soul Heart if they would otherwise have no health.
	+ All health will be lost when changing into  [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"). Changing from The Lost to any other character will leave them with a half [Soul Heart](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart").
	+ (Removed in Repentance)  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") will always start with 2 [Coin Heart](/wiki/Coin_Heart "Coin Heart") containers. Bone and Half Soul/Black Hearts will be rounded up to 1 or 2 filled coins. Red Hearts are not rounded which allows him to have half Coin Hearts. Changing from Keeper to any other character will turn his Coin Hearts into Red Hearts.
		- (Added in Repentance) All Red Heart containers are converted to Coin Heart containers when transforming into Keeper, with a minimum of 2 and up to a maximum of 3. Only red hearts will determine if the coin heart containers are filled or not, and Soul/Black hearts will be converted into blue flies. One coin heart container will be filled if he would otherwise have no health. Changing from Keeper to any other character will turn his Coin Hearts into Red Hearts.
	+ Changing into  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") will not affect  [(The Soul)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)")'s health. Red Hearts are converted into [Bone Hearts](/wiki/Bone_Heart "Bone Heart"). Soul/Black Hearts will be lost. He will gain an empty Bone Heart if he would otherwise have no health.
	+ (Added in Repentance) All soul hearts will be converted to soul charges when changing into  [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany"). She will gain one full Red Heart container if she would otherwise have no health. Changing from Bethany to any other character will convert her soul charges into soul hearts.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Heart Containers will be divided evenly and split up when changing into  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau"). Changing from Jacob and Esau to any other character will leave them with Jacob and Esau's combined health.
* Activating Clicker typically only consumes passive items, but with [(Schoolbag)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") it can consume the item in the other activated item slot if that item was the most recently collected.
* Similarly to items such as [(Judas' Shadow)](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow") [Judas' Shadow](/wiki/Judas%27_Shadow "Judas' Shadow") and [(Lazarus' Rags)](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags") [Lazarus' Rags](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags"), any [completion marks](/wiki/Completion_mark "Completion mark") obtained will correspond with the character the Clicker turns you into.
	+ (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Cain)](/wiki/Tainted_Cain "Tainted Cain") [Tainted Cain](/wiki/Tainted_Cain "Tainted Cain") can craft the Clicker and other useful items and then use Clicker to change characters. In this way, runs started as Tainted Cain can be useful to complete other character's completion marks, even when Tainted Cain's own completion marks are finished. Although Clicker will only turn tainted characters into other tainted characters, Tainted Cain can also craft [(Lazarus' Rags)](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags") [Lazarus' Rags](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags") and die to become a non-tainted character and could then use the Clicker to change into other non-tainted characters.
* (Removed in Repentance) Removed items still count towards [transformations](/wiki/Transformation "Transformation").
* Changing into  [(Eden)](/wiki/Eden "Eden") [Eden](/wiki/Eden "Eden") or (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Eden)](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden") [Tainted Eden](/wiki/Tainted_Eden "Tainted Eden") will not use tokens. Additionally, (Tainted) Eden's base stats will be the same as Isaac's if he wasn't the character selected at the start of the run.
* (Added in Repentance) Changing into  [(Jacob and Esau)](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") [Jacob and Esau](/wiki/Jacob_and_Esau "Jacob and Esau") will randomly distribute items between the two. Changing from Jacob and Esau to any other character will leave them with Jacob and Esau's combined items. Changing into or from Jacob and Esau will drop the currently held consumables like [pills](/wiki/Pills "Pills"), [cards](/wiki/Cards "Cards") etc. on the floor, but will keep trinkets (if they were held by Jacob or any other character). Esau's trinkets will always be dropped on the ground when changing to a different character.
* If [(Dead Cat)](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") [Dead Cat](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") was the last item to be picked up, Clicker will remove individual lives instead of the entire item.
* If [(Halo of Flies)](/wiki/Halo_of_Flies "Halo of Flies") [Halo of Flies](/wiki/Halo_of_Flies "Halo of Flies") was the last item to be picked up, Clicker will only remove one fly at a time (including [Pretty Flies](/wiki/Pretty_Fly "Pretty Fly") obtained from [pills](/wiki/Pills "Pills") and [Slot Machines](/wiki/Slot_Machine "Slot Machine")) instead of the entire item.

Interactions[]
--------------


* [(Car Battery)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): Isaac will transform twice and have the last two picked up items removed.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Rock Bottom)](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom") [Rock Bottom](/wiki/Rock_Bottom "Rock Bottom"): Stat upgrades given by removed items are retained, and the best stats of each character you turn into are retained, possibly creating some powerful characters, like Tainted Keeper with all the Berserk stats of Tainted Samson.
