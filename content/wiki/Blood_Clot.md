 # Blood Clot ![image](/image/Blood_Clot.png) 


Effects
---------


* Replaces Isaac's tears with a sword he can swing in front of him.
	+ The swing does 3x Isaac's [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") +3.5 and deals knockback to both enemies and Isaac if it hits.
	+ The sword can be swung as rapidly as the fire button can be tapped.
	+ The sword swing can collect [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups").
* If Isaac's total health is equal to or greater than his number of [Red Heart containers](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health") (same rule as regular [Challenge Rooms](/wiki/Challenge_Room "Challenge Room")), the sword fires a projectile when swung.
	+ The projectile deals damage equal to Isaac's damage +2, and has a cooldown equal to 2x Isaac's normal [tear rate](/wiki/Tears "Tears").
* Holding an attack button charges a spin attack, ready when the sword flashes, which damages all enemies around Isaac. It also deflects enemy projectiles, which can damage enemies who get hit, and launches a projectile regardless of Isaac's current health.
	+ The circular swing deals 8x Isaac's damage +10, and the projectile created from it deals 4x Isaac's damage +4.
	+ The charge time is based on Isaac's tears stat, at ~4x Isaac's normal tear rate.
	+ While charging, the sword will damage the first enemy that contacts it. This will cancel the spin attack.


Notes
-------


* Spirit Sword has the highest priority of all tear modifiers in the game, over [![image](/image/Epic_Fetus.png)](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") [Epic Fetus](/wiki/Epic_Fetus "Epic Fetus") and [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Knife.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife") [Mom's Knife](/wiki/Mom%27s_Knife "Mom's Knife").
* Unlike most charge attacks, the direction of the attack can't be changed by pressing and holding a different attack button then releasing the old one. Instead, it will stay pointing the same direction until all attack buttons are released, either doing nothing or using the spin attack, or the sword touches and damages an enemy, dealing sword slash damage.
* Spirit Sword can be used to open [Spiked Chests](/wiki/Chests#Spiked_Chest "Chests") and Mimics without taking damage.
* Range upgrades move the hitbox of the sword forwards, including the spin attack. Enough range upgrades can leave a large blind spot directly in front of the sword.
* Only the projectile and spin attack are affected by tear rate, not the normal sword swing, meaning that items that increase damage but decrease tear rate, such as [![image](/image/Polyphemus.png)](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") [Polyphemus](/wiki/Polyphemus "Polyphemus") and [![image](/image/Eve%27s_Mascara.png)](/wiki/Eve%27s_Mascara "Eve's Mascara") [Eve's Mascara](/wiki/Eve%27s_Mascara "Eve's Mascara"), are much more effective when only using the swing. Additionally, items that do the inverse, such as [![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") and [![image](/image/Almond_Milk.png)](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk") [Almond Milk](/wiki/Almond_Milk "Almond Milk"); are not as effective when only using the swing.
* Spirit Sword will deflect [Mother](/wiki/Mother "Mother")'s Fistula attack and will send it right back at her, entering a short sequence that allows to deal bonus damage, if executed correctly; see the [page](/wiki/Mother#Phase_1 "Mother") for more details.
* Spirit Sword is overridden by the Blindfolded effect (challenges like [Cat Got Your Tongue](/wiki/Cat_Got_Your_Tongue "Cat Got Your Tongue") or playing with [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith"))

	+ Caution should be taken as having full red heart containers (or no red heart containers) will cause a sword beam to always fire when using the regular swing which means any swing (or any spin regardless of red heart containers) will damage Isaac when using the sword at melee range unless he has explosion immunity.
