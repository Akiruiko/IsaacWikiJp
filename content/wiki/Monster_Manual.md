Effect
--------


* Upon [death](/wiki/Death "Death"), Isaac will respawn as  [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Character) "??? (Character)") in the most recent non-hostile room, with 3 [(Soul Heart)](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart").


Notes
-------


* Resurrection items activate in a [set order](/wiki/Category:Revival_items "Category:Revival items"). Ankh is (Removed in Repentance) 6th / (Added in Repentance) 8th in this order after (Added in Repentance)[(Soul of Lazarus)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Soul of Lazarus") [Soul of Lazarus](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), [![image](/image/1up!.png)](/wiki/1up! "1up!") [1up!](/wiki/1up! "1up!"),  [(Lazarus)](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus") [Lazarus](/wiki/Lazarus "Lazarus")' extra life, [![image](/image/Dead_Cat.png)](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat") [Dead Cat](/wiki/Dead_Cat "Dead Cat"), (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Inner_Child.png)](/wiki/Inner_Child "Inner Child") [Inner Child](/wiki/Inner_Child "Inner Child"), [![image](/image/Guppy%27s_Collar.png)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Collar "Guppy's Collar") [Guppy's Collar](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Collar "Guppy's Collar"), and [![image](/image/Lazarus%27_Rags.png)](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags") [Lazarus' Rags](/wiki/Lazarus%27_Rags "Lazarus' Rags").
* Like other items that grant an extra life, but respawn Isaac as a different character, all [completion marks](/wiki/Completion_mark "Completion mark") earned from the moment of death onward will count towards the new character, not the old.
* (Added in Repentance) During (Added in Repentance) [(The Beast)](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") [The Beast](/wiki/The_Beast "The Beast") fight, Isaac respawns in the place he died.
