 # Head of the Keeper ![image](/image/Head_of_the_Keeper.png) 

Effects
---------


* Enemies have a 5% chance to drop a [Penny](/wiki/Coins#Penny "Coins") when hit with Isaac's tears.
	+ The chance is not affected by [Luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").
* Turns Isaac's tears into coins (cosmetic effect).


Notes
-------


* (Added in Repentance) As of Repentance, the only way of finding Head of the Keeper is by bombing Shopkeepers or using (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Spindown_Dice.png)](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") [Spindown Dice](/wiki/Spindown_Dice "Spindown Dice") on [![image](/image/Papa_Fly.png)](/wiki/Papa_Fly "Papa Fly") [Papa Fly](/wiki/Papa_Fly "Papa Fly").
* Does not produce coins other than Pennies.
* Hitting the front side of enemies such as the [Knight](/wiki/Knight "Knight") will still produce Pennies, even though the enemy does not sustain any damage. This can be exploited to produce an infinite amount of Pennies from a single enemy. This however doesn't work with lowered [Hosts](/wiki/Host "Host").
	+ Enemies that spawn other enemies, [Globins](/wiki/Globin "Globin"), or enemies that regain health can also be farmed for infinite money.
* (Removed in Repentance) Head of the Keeper does not work with  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") but will work with  [![image](/image/The_Soul.png)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)").
* When used against [Ultra Greed](/wiki/Ultra_Greed "Ultra Greed"), the coins are spawned directly in front of him and will thus heal him very often.

* (Added in Repentance)[(Nuh Uh!)](/wiki/Nuh_Uh! "Nuh Uh!") [Nuh Uh!](/wiki/Nuh_Uh! "Nuh Uh!"): From Chapter 4 and beyond, any coins spawned will be from the loot table of Nuh Uh! instead, with an occasional harmless black fly spawning.
* [![image](/image/Soy_Milk.png)](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk") [Soy Milk](/wiki/Soy_Milk "Soy Milk"): Due to the Soy Milk's high fire rate and low damage, enemies can be hit many more times than usual, resulting in a larger amount of coins dropping.
