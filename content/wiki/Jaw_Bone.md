Effects
---------


* Spawns a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that fires across the [room](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms") in the direction of the first tear fired and returns to Isaac when it hits a wall, similar to [![image](/image/Little_Chubby.png)](/wiki/Little_Chubby "Little Chubby") [Little Chubby](/wiki/Little_Chubby "Little Chubby"). Deals a flat 7 damage to enemies that come in contact with it.
	+ When thrown, the familiar will pierce through enemies if they are killed by the familiar, but the familiar will bounce back to Isaac if the enemy is not killed.
	+ The familiar can pass through [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles").
	+ The familiar can retrieve [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") like [![image](/image/The_Boomerang.png)](/wiki/The_Boomerang "The Boomerang") [The Boomerang](/wiki/The_Boomerang "The Boomerang").
	+ Blocks enemy tears when stationary and when thrown.
	+ After returning to Isaac, it has a short recharge time before it can be fired again.


Notes
-------


* Just like [![image](/image/The_Boomerang.png)](/wiki/The_Boomerang "The Boomerang") [The Boomerang](/wiki/The_Boomerang "The Boomerang"), Jaw Bone can grab pickups through obstacles and will **not** grab [(Troll Bomb)](/wiki/Troll_Bomb "Troll Bomb") [Troll Bombs](/wiki/Troll_Bomb "Troll Bomb").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Familiar grows in size and does a flat 14 damage to enemies.
* [(Duct Tape)](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape") [Duct Tape](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape"): Jaw Bone will face in the same direction as Isaac and remain stationary as opposed to trailing behind him. Jaw Bone can still be fired.
