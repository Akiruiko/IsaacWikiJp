 # Kidney Stone ![image](/image/Kidney_Stone.png) 

Effects
---------


* (Removed in Repentance) -0.2 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") and maximum speed.
* (Removed in Repentance) -17 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
* (Removed in Repentance) +2.0 [tear height](/wiki/Tear_height "Tear height").
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The increased tear height and decreased range results in overall slightly less firing distance.
* Occasionally, firing tears will cause Isaac to charge an attack with his head pulsating with a red color. After the attack has charged up, the fire button can be released to fire a kidney stone that does 5 times Isaac's damage and pierces enemies, followed by a rapid, inaccurate spray of tears.
	+ This effect occurs approximately every 25 seconds.
	+ Isaac won't be able to fire tears normally until the kidney stone has been fired.
	+ The kidney stone has approximately twice the range of normal tears.
	+ The barrage will continue for its full length between [rooms](/wiki/Room "Room"), as will the state of charging the attack instead of firing tears.
* When Isaac has half a heart left, the urine that appears underneath Isaac upon entering rooms will be changed to red.


Notes
-------


* Tints tears red. This is only a cosmetic change.
* [![image](/image/Incubus.png)](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") [Incubus](/wiki/Incubus "Incubus") will still fire tears normally while retaining the barrage effect, making this a good item for  [(Lilith)](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith") [Lilith](/wiki/Lilith "Lilith").
	+ The barrage from the Incubus will be in a straight line (similar to [![image](/image/Cursed_Eye.png)](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye") [Cursed Eye](/wiki/Cursed_Eye "Cursed Eye")) instead of an inaccurate burst.
	+ The kidney stone itself will come out of Lilith, not the Incubus follower, even though she cannot fire tears. The barrage of tears will still only come from the Incubus. This also applies if blindfolded as another character.
	+ This is the only item to be able to override the Grayscale easter egg.
	+ This item does not appear to work at all for (Added in Repentance)  [(Tainted Lilith)](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith") [Tainted Lilith](/wiki/Tainted_Lilith "Tainted Lilith").
