 # The Polaroid ![image](/image/The_Polaroid.png) 


Effects
---------


* The first cube creates an [Orbital Familiar](/wiki/Orbital_Familiar "Orbital Familiar") which deals (Removed in Repentance) 105/(Added in Repentance) 56 damage per second.
* Each subsequent Cube of Meat obtained are combined with the first one (increasing its 'level'), changing its characteristics:
	+ Level 2: Gives the orbital the ability to shoot tears that deal 3.5 damage every (Removed in Repentance) 1/(Added in Repentance) 0.66 second(s).
	+ Level 3: Changes it from an orbital to a Meat Boy that that chases nearby enemies dealing (Removed in Repentance) 7/(Added in Repentance) 10 contact damage per second
	+ Level 4: Increases the size of the Meat Boy larger and increases its damage to (Removed in Repentance) 11/(Added in Repentance) 20 per second.
	+ The fifth Cube of Meat will create a new Level 1 cube, and start the cycle again.


Notes
-------


* Multiple Cubes of Meat can be collected in a single run.
* (Added in Repentance) The orbital orbits Isaac significantly faster.
* [(Famine)](/wiki/Famine "Famine") [Famine](/wiki/Famine "Famine"), [(Pestilence)](/wiki/Pestilence "Pestilence") [Pestilence](/wiki/Pestilence "Pestilence"), [(War)](/wiki/War "War") [War](/wiki/War "War"), and [(Death)](/wiki/Death_(Boss)#Death "Death") [Death](/wiki/Death_(Boss)#Death "Death (Boss)") will always drop either a [![image](/image/Ball_of_Bandages.png)](/wiki/Ball_of_Bandages "Ball of Bandages") [Ball of Bandages](/wiki/Ball_of_Bandages "Ball of Bandages") or Cube of Meat. After the first one drops, further Harbingers will only drop that same one and never the other for the duration of the run.
* The ticking rate for Meat Boys' contact damage causes them to often deal damage twice once they touch an enemy, making their first second of DPS up to 1.5x higher than normal.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Book_of_Revelations.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Revelations "Book of Revelations") [Book of Revelations](/wiki/Book_of_Revelations "Book of Revelations"): Ensures that [Harbingers](/wiki/Harbingers "Harbingers") that haven't already been defeated will replace their respective floor's boss, making it drastically easier to collect multiple Cubes of Meat.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Box_of_Friends.png)](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") [Box of Friends](/wiki/Box_of_Friends "Box of Friends") / [![image](/image/Monster_Manual.png)](/wiki/Monster_Manual "Monster Manual") [Monster Manual](/wiki/Monster_Manual "Monster Manual"): Additional copies of Ball of Bandages combine with the first, increasing its level as normal.
* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Potato_Peeler.png)](/wiki/Potato_Peeler "Potato Peeler") [Potato Peeler](/wiki/Potato_Peeler "Potato Peeler"): Consumes 1 [Heart Container](/wiki/Heart_Container "Heart Container") in return for creating 1 Cube of Meat and increasing damage a little.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Duct Tape)](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape") [Duct Tape](/wiki/Duct_Tape "Duct Tape"): Familiar will stay in place relative to Isaac at levels 1 and 2. No effect at levels 3 and 4.
* [Pretty Fly](/wiki/Pretty_Fly "Pretty Fly"): Cube of Meat will replace one if Isaac already has 3 Pretty Flies. If the Cube of Meat reaches level 3 or 4, the Pretty Fly will come back until another Cube of Meat orbital is obtained.
