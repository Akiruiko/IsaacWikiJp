Effects[]
---------


* Spawns an [orbital familiar](/wiki/Orbital_familiar "Orbital familiar") that blocks enemy shots and deals 7 damage per tick or 105 damage per second on contact ((Added in Repentance) 56 damage per second).
	+ It also attracts enemy shots to itself, making them more likely to be blocked. A shot actively being attracted can no longer damage Isaac and is essentially nullified, but if it slips outside the Protector's range, it can again deal damage.
* Sworn Protector will drop an [Eternal Heart](/wiki/Eternal_Heart "Eternal Heart") upon blocking 10 shots in one [room](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms").
	+ This can only happen once per room, but leaving and re-entering a room will allow another eternal heart to be dropped.
* (Removed in Repentance) This item belongs to the [Seraphim](/wiki/Seraphim_(Transformation) "Seraphim (Transformation)") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into an angel.
* (Added in Repentance) This item belongs to the [Conjoined](/wiki/Conjoined "Conjoined") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into a three-faced version of himself.


Notes[]
-------


* Sworn Protector can be exploited with the help of a [Constant Stone Shooter](/wiki/Constant_Stone_Shooter "Constant Stone Shooter") to spawn unlimited eternal hearts.


Interactions[]
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Extension Cord)](/wiki/Extension_Cord "Extension Cord") [Extension Cord](/wiki/Extension_Cord "Extension Cord"): Familiar and Isaac are occasionally connected by electricity but it is very hard to notice because of Sworn Protector orbits so close to Isaac.
* [(Friendly Ball)](/wiki/Friendly_Ball "Friendly Ball") [Friendly Ball](/wiki/Friendly_Ball "Friendly Ball") / (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Poke Go)](/wiki/Poke_Go "Poke Go") [Poke Go](/wiki/Poke_Go "Poke Go"): Catching an enemy that shoots bullets allows Eternal Hearts to be farmed since the enemy will fire at Isaac if no other enemies are in the room.
