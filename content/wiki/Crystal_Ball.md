 # Crystal Ball ![image](/image/Crystal_Ball.png) 

Effects
---------


Upon use, it:



* Reveals the [floor](/wiki/Chapters "Chapters") layout and all special rooms except the [Super Secret Room](/wiki/Super_Secret_Room "Super Secret Room").
* Drops either a [(Soul Heart)](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") [Soul Heart](/wiki/Soul_Heart "Soul Heart") or a random [card or rune](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"). (50% chance of either)
* (Added in Repentance) While held, increases the chance of finding a [Planetarium](/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium") by 15%, or 100% if a treasure room has been skipped.


Notes
-------


* The map revealing effect will not work if the [Curse of the Lost](/wiki/Curse_of_the_Lost "Curse of the Lost") is active.
* It's possible to get more than one Crystal Ball from [Fortune Tellers](/wiki/Machines "Machines") on a single run.
* (Added in Repentance) The Planetarium bonus guarantees the level generation to *attempt* placing one, but the level layout may not have enough room. Read the article on (Planetarium) [Planetariums](/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium") for further details.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Wisps have much greater health than normal wisps. Tears that are fired from the wisps will auto aim towards nearby enemies, similar to [![image](/image/Demon_Baby.png)](/wiki/Demon_Baby "Demon Baby") [Demon Baby](/wiki/Demon_Baby "Demon Baby").


Interactions
--------------


* [(Daemon's Tail)](/wiki/Daemon%27s_Tail "Daemon's Tail") [Daemon's Tail](/wiki/Daemon%27s_Tail "Daemon's Tail"): The chance to drop cards or runes will change to 90%/10% in favor of cards.
