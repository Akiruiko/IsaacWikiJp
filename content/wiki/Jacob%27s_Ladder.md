 # Jacob's Ladder ![image](/image/Jacob%27s_Ladder.png) 

Effects
---------


* (Removed in Repentance) Tears fire 1-2 sparks of electricity in random directions upon hitting an obstacle or enemy.
* (Added in Repentance) Tears fire 1 short-ranged spark of electricity in a random direction upon hitting an obstacle or enemy. When an arc strikes an enemy, it will strike another nearby enemy, chaining up to four times.
* Sparks deal half of the tear's damage.
	+ Sparks behave like [spectral](/wiki/Spectral_tears "Spectral tears") and [piercing](/wiki/Piercing_tears "Piercing tears") lasers and will arc to hit enemies that are close enough, even striking multiple ones in a row.
	+ An enemy can take damage multiple times from sparks of a single chain. If an enemy take damage from a tear, it does not take any damage from the chain which the tear causes.
	+ Tears that hit the floor due to running out of range do not generate arcs.
	+ (Added in Repentance) If the floor is wet, such as [(Downpour)](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour") [Downpour](/wiki/Downpour "Downpour"), [(Dross)](/wiki/Dross "Dross") [Dross](/wiki/Dross "Dross"), [(Flooded Caves)](/wiki/Flooded_Caves "Flooded Caves") [Flooded Caves](/wiki/Flooded_Caves "Flooded Caves"), some rooms in [(Scarred Womb)](/wiki/Scarred_Womb "Scarred Womb") [Scarred Womb](/wiki/Scarred_Womb "Scarred Womb") and after using [![image](/image/Flush!.png)](/wiki/Flush! "Flush!") [Flush!](/wiki/Flush! "Flush!"), the arcing distance is increased.
