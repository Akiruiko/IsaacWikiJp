 # Dim Bulb ![image](/image/Dim_Bulb.png) 

Effects
---------


* Increases all [stats](/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") while Isaac's active item is completely uncharged:
	+ +0.50 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed").
	+ +1.50 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
	+ (Removed in Repentance) +0.40 [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears").
	+ (Added in Repentance) +0.50 [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears").
	+ +0.30 [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed").
	+ +1.5 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
	+ +2 [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").
* Items that charge automatically will get only a tiny moment of benefit from the Dim Bulb before they gain more charge again.
* (Removed in Repentance) If Isaac's active item has no charge bar and can used anytime, like [(How to Jump)](/wiki/How_to_Jump "How to Jump") [How to Jump](/wiki/How_to_Jump "How to Jump"), Dim Bulb's effects will be permanent.


Notes
-------


* Dim Bulb is more than twice as powerful as [![image](/image/Vibrant_Bulb.png)](/wiki/Vibrant_Bulb "Vibrant Bulb") [Vibrant Bulb](/wiki/Vibrant_Bulb "Vibrant Bulb"); however, its effects are active less frequently.
	+ However, 1 room charge items can be used at the start of each room to effectively get the Dim Bulb's effects constantly.
* Dim Bulb has no effect when no active item is held.
* If the player has 2 items (via [(Schoolbag)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag")), only 1 of them needs to be empty to receive the benefits.
	+ This appears to have been patched out on PC. (Removed in Repentance) However, if one of your two active items has no charge bar (e.g. [(Remote Detonator)](/wiki/Remote_Detonator "Remote Detonator") [Remote Detonator](/wiki/Remote_Detonator "Remote Detonator")), you can swap to it after using the charged item to preserve the Bulb's effect.

-----------
