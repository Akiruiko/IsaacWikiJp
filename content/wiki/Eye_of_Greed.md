Effects[]
---------


* Adds a golden tear every 20 tears fired, which causes enemies to turn gold and [petrifies](/wiki/Status_Effects#Petrification "Status Effects") them for a few seconds (similar to [(Midas' Touch)](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") [Midas' Touch](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch")) at the cost of one [coin](/wiki/Coin "Coin"). Golden tears can still be fired if Isaac has no money.
	+ Unlike other tear effects, golden tears are fired alongside regular tears rather than replacing a regular tear.
	+ With multi-shot abilities, whichever tear is the 20th since previous will produce the additional golden tear.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The golden tear does 2x normal [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
		- (Added in Repentance) If Isaac has no money, the golden tear does normal tear damage. If Isaac does have money, the golden tear deals 1.5x normal damage + 10.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) Enemies killed while golden will drop 1-4 coins.
		- (Added in Repentance) Enemies killed while golden will drop 1-3 coins.
	+ (Added in Repentance) If Isaac has money, golden tears that hit enemies will drop a [penny](/wiki/Coins#Penny "Coins"), effectively returning the cost.


Notes[]
-------


* Tears fired from items that cause multiple tears to be fired at once, e.g. [(20/20)](/wiki/20/20 "20/20") [20/20](/wiki/20/20 "20/20"), [(Monstro's Lung)](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung") [Monstro's Lung](/wiki/Monstro%27s_Lung "Monstro's Lung"), etc., are counted.
	+ The gold tear is not duplicated by said items.
* [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") has separate tear counters for The Forgotten and Soul.
* Using this item is an easy way of unlocking (Added in Repentance)[(Golden Razor)](/wiki/Golden_Razor "Golden Razor") [Golden Razor](/wiki/Golden_Razor "Golden Razor") after obtaining 99 coins, since it drains them by just shooting and with enough patience it will reduce their count to 0.


Synergies[]
-----------


* [(Chocolate Milk)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): How much the 20th tear was charged determines the size and damage of the golden tear.
* [(Compound Fracture)](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") [Compound Fracture](/wiki/Compound_Fracture "Compound Fracture") / [(Cricket's Body)](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") [Cricket's Body](/wiki/Cricket%27s_Body "Cricket's Body") / [(The Parasite)](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite") [The Parasite](/wiki/The_Parasite "The Parasite"): Golden tears will still look like coins and will still split into other golden coins when hitting obstacles.
* [(Equality!)](/wiki/Equality! "Equality!") [Equality!](/wiki/Equality! "Equality!"): The coin lost when firing the tear can be quite useful for equalizing the pickup counter.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Humbling Bundle)](/wiki/Humbling_Bundle "Humbling Bundle") [Humbling Bundle](/wiki/Humbling_Bundle "Humbling Bundle"): Affects coins dropped from hitting enemies, allowing Isaac to potentially farm money.
* [(Lachryphagy)](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy") [Lachryphagy](/wiki/Lachryphagy "Lachryphagy"): Golden tears can also be fed and will burst into split tears. Burst tears are not golden.
