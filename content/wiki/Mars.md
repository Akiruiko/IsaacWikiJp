 # Mars ![image](/image/Mars.png) 


Effect
--------


* Duplicates 1 random [pickup](/wiki/Pickup "Pickup") in the current room, including [cards](/wiki/Card "Card"), [runes](/wiki/Rune "Rune"), [chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest"), (Removed in Repentance) and [trinkets](/wiki/Trinket "Trinket").


Notes
-------


* By dropping a card, rune, or pill in a room with no other pickups, then using D1, this item can function similarly to [![image](/image/Blank_Card.png)](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card") [Blank Card](/wiki/Blank_Card "Blank Card"), [![image](/image/Placebo.png)](/wiki/Placebo "Placebo") [Placebo](/wiki/Placebo "Placebo"), and (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Clear_Rune.png)](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune") [Clear Rune](/wiki/Clear_Rune "Clear Rune").
* [(Rune of Jera)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Rune of Jera") [Rune of Jera](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") can not be duplicated.
* Mimic Chests will not be duplicated.
* A normal Chest may be duplicated into a Red Chest or a Mimic Chest.
* Opened chests will be duplicated into an unopened copy.
* (Removed in Repentance) A duplicated trinket is mostly useless, as you cannot pick up two of the same trinket even with [![image](/image/Mom%27s_Purse.png)](/wiki/Mom%27s_Purse "Mom's Purse") [Mom's Purse](/wiki/Mom%27s_Purse "Mom's Purse"), [![image](/image/Belly_Button.png)](/wiki/Belly_Button "Belly Button") [Belly Button](/wiki/Belly_Button "Belly Button"), or [![image](/image/Smelter.png)](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter").
	+ However, with "consumable" trinkets such as [(Store Credit)](/wiki/Store_Credit "Store Credit") [Store Credit](/wiki/Store_Credit "Store Credit") or [(Bag Lunch)](/wiki/Bag_Lunch "Bag Lunch") [Bag Lunch](/wiki/Bag_Lunch "Bag Lunch"), it can be extremely powerful.
* It is possible to duplicate (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop") pickups that have not been purchased yet.
* With [![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"), it is possible to infinitely generate Lil' Batteries from a single Lil' Battery.
* In combination with a [48 Hour Energy](/wiki/48_Hour_Energy "48 Hour Energy") pill and [(Paper Clip)](/wiki/Paper_Clip "Paper Clip") [Paper Clip](/wiki/Paper_Clip "Paper Clip"), the initial Locked Chests on [(Chest)](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest") [Chest](/wiki/Chest_(Floor) "Chest (Floor)") can be infinitely duplicated and opened.
* In [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode"), if a Lil' Battery appears in the (Shop) [Shop](/wiki/Shop "Shop") and a [(2 of Diamonds)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "2 of Diamonds") [2 of Diamonds](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") is acquired, infinite money can be gained by duplicating the Two of Diamonds.
* (Added in Repentance) With a [(? Card)](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") [? Card](/wiki/%3F_Card "? Card") and [![image](/image/Schoolbag.png)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"), single use items can be used an unlimited number of times by duplicating the card.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns two white six-sided die wisps, on the middle ring, at the same time. An extra wisp spawns if no pickups are duplicated.
