 # Bum Friend ![image](/image/Bum_Friend.png) 

Effects
---------


* Spawns a familiar who follows Isaac and picks up coins on the ground. (He does not fill up a familiar "slot".)
* After picking up 6 coins, Bum Friend will drop a pickup.
* After that, Bum Friend has a 67% chance to drop a pickup after picking up 3 coins and a 33% chance to drop a pickup after picking up 4 coins.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Super Bum](/wiki/Super_Bum "Super Bum") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac's bums into Super Bum.


Notes
-------


* Bum Friend cannot pick up [Sticky Nickels](/wiki/Sticky_Nickel "Sticky Nickel").
* Bum Friend can pick up [Lucky Pennies](/wiki/Lucky_Penny "Lucky Penny"), but it will simply count as a regular Penny and will not grant [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").
* From a scoring perspective, Pennies that Bum Friend picks up count towards your [Schwag bonus](/wiki/Schwag_bonus "Schwag bonus") on daily runs.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): All future drops will happen every 3 coins. If the next scheduled drop at the moment of acquiring BFFS! requires more than 3 coins, the amount will not be lowered.
* [![image](/image/Mitre.png)](/wiki/Mitre "Mitre") [Mitre](/wiki/Mitre "Mitre"): [Red Hearts](/wiki/Red_Heart "Red Heart") that Bum drops can be converted into [Soul Hearts](/wiki/Hearts "Hearts").
