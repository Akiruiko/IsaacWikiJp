 # Broken Syringe ![image](/image/Broken_Syringe.png) 

Effects
---------


* When Isaac enters a new room, has a chance to give the effect of any [syringe](/wiki/Syringes "Syringes") for the current room.


Notes
-------


* If [(Experimental Treatment)](/wiki/Experimental_Treatment "Experimental Treatment") [Experimental Treatment](/wiki/Experimental_Treatment "Experimental Treatment") activates, it will give 3 random stat increases and decreases, as opposed to 4 stat increases and 2 decreases. Health cannot be one of the stats it selects.
* The chance for Broken Syringe to activate is unaffected by [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").
* Syringes that have not been unlocked can still be granted as one of the effects.
