Effects[]
---------


* Spawns a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that stabs Isaac at the beginning of each floor, if Isaac has more than half of a red heart. This will drain as many red hearts as possible without killing him (leaving half a red heart if Isaac only had red hearts, or none at all if Isaac has soul/black/bone hearts).
* Even though the animation is only a single stab when the effect triggers, it is treated as taking damage one time per half heart lost. This can lead to great synergies with items that activate on damage taken.
* For the rest of the floor, Isaac gains +(0.15 * HeartsLost ^ 2) [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") and +(0.1 * HeartsLost) [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed"), where HeartsLost is the total hearts of damage taken from Blood Oath (half a heart counts as 0.5).
	+ This amounts to a max of +19.8 damage and +1.15 speed if starting the floor with 12 filled hearts (of which only 11.5 are drained).
		- This increases to +21.6 and +1.2 if starting the floor with 12 filled hearts, at least one being a Bone Heart.


Notes[]
-------


* Isaac can avoid damage from Blood Oath with invincibility, but he won't gain the damage and speed increase if he does.
* Eternal hearts give the health up before Blood Oath stabs Isaac, draining that extra heart too.
* It's also possible to use [(XI - Strength)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XI - Strength") [XI - Strength](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") at the beginning of a floor before getting hit by Blood Oath to have one more heart counted in the bonus.
* If Isaac has only half a red heart, the effect will not trigger at the start of the floor, even if Isaac has soul/black hearts. Having no red hearts at all also prevents the effect from triggering.
* Works with  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") /  [(Tainted Keeper)](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") [Tainted Keeper](/wiki/Tainted_Keeper "Tainted Keeper") leaving his health at one health coin.
* The damage caused by Blood Oath does not lower the chance for a (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") or (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") to appear.
* While playing as  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten"), red health will not be drained if  [(The Soul)](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul") [The Soul](/wiki/The_Soul_(Character) "The Soul (Character)") was being controlled when entering the floor.
* If Blood Oath is removed (such as with  [(Tainted Isaac)](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac") [Tainted Isaac](/wiki/Tainted_Isaac "Tainted Isaac")), any existing damage and speed bonuses will not be removed until moving to the next floor as normal.
	+ An exception is after you defeat [(The Lamb)](/wiki/The_Lamb "The Lamb") [The Lamb](/wiki/The_Lamb "The Lamb") and refuse a [Victory Lap](/wiki/Victory_Lap "Victory Lap"), the damage and speed bonuses are removed.
* Upon getting stabbed, any items that trigger upon getting hit will activate multiple times depending on the number of hearts drained.
* If Isaac has rotten hearts they will only count as half a red heart when blood oath activates.
