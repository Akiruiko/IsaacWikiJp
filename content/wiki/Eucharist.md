 # Eucharist ![image](/image/Eucharist.png) 

Effect
--------


* An [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") Door will always spawn after every boss fight.
	+ [Devil Rooms](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room") will no longer appear.
	+ The spawned door will not disappear when leaving and re-entering the boss room (except in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode")).


Notes
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Eucharist applies two effects. Like [![image](/image/Goat_Head.png)](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head") [Goat Head](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head"), it fixes the [Devil Room chance](/wiki/Devil_Room#Conditions_to_make_Devil_Rooms_appear "Devil Room") at 100%, which forces an Angel/Devil Room to spawn whenever it can; it also fixes the [Angel Room chance](/wiki/Angel_Room#Angel_Room_Generation_Chance "Angel Room") at 100%, so the game always chooses an Angel door over a Devil door.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Now instead fixes the Angel Room chance at 100%, and the Devil Room chance at 0%.
* If the Devil Room has been visited before picking up Eucharist, an Angel Room will not replace it, despite the Angel Room chance displaying 100%.


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Duality.png)](/wiki/Duality "Duality") [Duality](/wiki/Duality "Duality"): Both Angel and Devil Room doors spawn after every boss, and the selected door will never disappear.
	+ This is the only way to encounter Devil deals while possessing Eucharist.
* [(Filigree Feather)](/wiki/Filigree_Feather "Filigree Feather") [Filigree Feather](/wiki/Filigree_Feather "Filigree Feather"): Due to Angel Rooms being guaranteed, a large influx of items can be obtained over time.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Goat_Head.png)](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head") [Goat Head](/wiki/Goat_Head "Goat Head"): Overridden by Eucharist.
