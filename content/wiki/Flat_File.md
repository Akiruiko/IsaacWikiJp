 # Flat File ![image](/image/Flat_File.png) 

Effects
---------


* Makes all spikes retract, preventing them from dealing damage.
	+ Most spikes leave behind holes or a visual cue showing where they would normally be.
	+ The spikes around [Curse Room](/wiki/Curse_Room "Curse Room") doors are removed, allowing them to be entered and exited without taking damage.
	+ Retracts damaging spikes from [Spiked Rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks") and [Spiked/Mimic Chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests").
	+ Removes the spikes from [Pokies](/wiki/Poky "Poky"), [Slides](/wiki/Slide "Slide"), and [Wall Huggers](/wiki/Wall_Hugger "Wall Hugger").
		- Pokies, Slides, and Wall Huggers don't immediately stop moving once they are despiked, and are still able to push Isaac without dealing damage.
		- Has no effect on [Grudges](/wiki/Grudge "Grudge"), neither retracting their spikes nor despawning them.
	+ Causes [Spikeballs](/wiki/Spikeball "Spikeball") to despawn.
		- Doesn't despawn or retract the spikes on [Ball and Chains](/wiki/Ball_and_Chain "Ball and Chain").
		- Doesn't cause the moveable spike balls in [Singe](/wiki/Singe "Singe")'s boss room to despawn or despike.


Notes
-------


* If Flat File is dropped in a room with spikes, the spikes will not extend again unless the room is left and re-entered.
	+ Spiked Rocks will not re-extend their spikes.
* [Mimic Chests](/wiki/Mimic_Chest "Mimic Chest") won't change their contents when Isaac is up close to them (visible with [(Guppy's Eye)](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye") [Guppy's Eye](/wiki/Guppy%27s_Eye "Guppy's Eye")) if opened under the effect of Flat File.
* Flat File also retracts the spikes in the center of [Sacrifice Rooms](/wiki/Sacrifice_Room "Sacrifice Room"), making them unusable while the trinket is held. The spikes reappear after dropping the trinket and re-entering the room.
* Flat File does not prevent [The Pile](/wiki/The_Pile "The Pile") or [Mama Gurdy](/wiki/Mama_Gurdy "Mama Gurdy") from using their spike attacks.
* Also removes spikes from doors in the [Cursed!](/wiki/Cursed! "Cursed!") challenge, making it much easier.
