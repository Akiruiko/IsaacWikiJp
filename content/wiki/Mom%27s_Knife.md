Effects[]
---------


* Isaac's tears are replaced by a knife that pierces enemies and can travel through obstacles. Holding down the fire button increases its range and power.
* The knife deals damage 20 times per second upon contact with enemies while Isaac is holding it.
* The knife deals 2x Isaac's damage while held and 6x damage at the furthest possible point of its throw distance, regardless of the actual maximum range stat.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Damage dealt by the knife depends on its charge state instead of its actual range. The knife deals 2x Isaac's damage when held and 6x damage at about 1/3 of full charge. The knife damage quickly drops to 2x Isaac's damage when returning regardless of charge state. Further charging only increases its maximum range.
* (Added in Afterbirth) This item belongs to the [Yes Mother?](/wiki/Yes_Mother%3F "Yes Mother?") set. Collecting three items from this set will transform Isaac into his mother.


Notes[]
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) Mom's Knife is a [special item](/wiki/Special_item "Special item").
* The knife can be held and fired diagonally. Firing the knife diagonally requires a frame perfect input. However, this can be done easily with a controller's analog stick or with (Added in Afterbirth †)[(Analog Stick)](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick") [Analog Stick](/wiki/Analog_Stick "Analog Stick").
	+ (Added in Repentance) The knife can now be fired in any direction.
* The knife will *not* work in challenges with the [blindfolded](/wiki/Blindfolded "Blindfolded") effect.

	+ **The Ludovico Technique** + **Lost Contact**: Floating knife loses almost all ability to block bullets, with a tiny area around the hilt that can stop shots.
