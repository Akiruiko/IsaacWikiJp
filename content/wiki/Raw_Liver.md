 # Raw Liver ![image](/image/Raw_Liver.png) 


Effects
---------


* [Activated items](/wiki/Items#Activated_Collectibles "Items") can store an extra level of charge, allowing them to be used twice in one room.
	+ Extra charges appear in yellow over the normal charge meter.


Notes
-------


* The Battery does not affect self-recharging activated items.
	+ (Added in Afterbirth â€ ) Self-recharging active items can charge the yellow meter, allowing Isaac to use them twice immediately.
* (Added in Repentance) If the recharge time of Isaac's held item is less than 6 and he picks up a [Lil' Battery](/wiki/Lil%27_Battery "Lil' Battery"), it'll overcharge the item for the remaining charges left in the Lil' Battery.


Synergies
-----------


* [48 Hour Energy](/wiki/48_Hour_Energy "48 Hour Energy") pill: A fully discharged item will be doubly charged, along with spawning 1 or 2 [Lil' Batteries](/wiki/Lil%27_Battery "Lil' Battery").
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Friendly_Ball.png)](/wiki/Friendly_Ball "Friendly Ball") [Friendly Ball](/wiki/Friendly_Ball "Friendly Ball"): Walking over a captured enemy will double charge the ball, allowing the enemy to be released, and allowing to catch a new one in the same room, and the process repeats. This allows the Friendly Ball to be used much, *much* more often, and gathering many more friends. Note: trying to catch a new enemy while the old one is in the process of spawning will result in the ball phasing through, catching nothing, thus wasting charge.
* (Added in Repentance) [![image](/image/Notched_Axe.png)](/wiki/Notched_Axe "Notched Axe") [Notched Axe](/wiki/Notched_Axe "Notched Axe"): Causes remaining charge from the previous floor to carry over to the next one.
