 # Devil's Crown ![image](/image/Devil%27s_Crown.png) 

Effects
---------


* Every (Treasure Room) [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room") is replaced with a (Devil Treasure Room) **Devil Treasure Room** that contain items from the [Devil Room item pool](/wiki/Devil_Room_(Item_Pool) "Devil Room (Item Pool)") that can be bought for the usual number of [Heart Containers](/wiki/Heart_Container "Heart Container") normally requested (for the spawned item) in a (Devil Room) [Devil Room](/wiki/Devil_Room "Devil Room").


Notes
-------


* The (Devil Treasure Room) **Devil Treasure Room** generated will be the same as the (Treasure Room) [Treasure Room](/wiki/Treasure_Room "Treasure Room") that would have been generated, minus the item and room textures.
	+ If the Treasure Room would have been a double Treasure Room, the Devil Treasure Room will also have two items. Unlike the double Treasure Room, however, both items can be taken. This also goes for Treasure Rooms on the alternate path (the blind item will still be blind).
* This trinket also converts Treasure rooms on the current floor when picked up. However, this only affects Treasure Rooms that have not been visited yet.
	+ The same goes vice-versa: dropping the trinket will convert Devil Treasure Rooms to normal ones unless they've been visited.
* Items bought in the Devil Treasure Rooms will affect (Angel Room) [Angel Room](/wiki/Angel_Room "Angel Room") chance like a normal [Deal with the Devil](/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil "Deal with the Devil") would.
* When entering floors during the [Ascent](/wiki/Ascent "Ascent"), Treasure Rooms that you visited during the run will keep their previous state, and will be unaffected by this trinket.
	+ However, unvisited Treasure Rooms can still be converted by dropping and picking up the trinket.
* Does not affect the Silver Treasure Rooms in [Greed Mode](/wiki/Greed_Mode "Greed Mode").
* Extra treasure rooms generated by [(Red Key)](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key") [Red Key](/wiki/Red_Key "Red Key") will be affected normally.
* Items spawned in Devil Treasure Rooms (e.g via [(Magic Skin)](/wiki/Magic_Skin "Magic Skin") [Magic Skin](/wiki/Magic_Skin "Magic Skin"), [(VI - The Lovers?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "VI - The Lovers?") [VI - The Lovers?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), [(XVII - The Stars?)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XVII - The Stars?") [XVII - The Stars?](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes"), etc.) will all be drawn from the [Devil Room item pool](/wiki/Devil_Room_(Item_Pool) "Devil Room (Item Pool)").
* Multiple choice Treasure Rooms, such as those generated in alternative floors and [(???)](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "???") [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F_(Floor) "??? (Floor)"), allow both items to be taken upon being converted to Devil Treasure Rooms.


Synergies
-----------


* [(More Options)](/wiki/More_Options "More Options") [More Options](/wiki/More_Options "More Options"): All (Devil Treasure Room) **Devil Treasure Room**s will have two items, both of which can be purchased.
	+ This also extends to [![image](/image/Broken_Glasses.png)](/wiki/Broken_Glasses "Broken Glasses") [Broken Glasses](/wiki/Broken_Glasses "Broken Glasses"), [![image](/image/Golden_Horse_Shoe.png)](/wiki/Golden_Horse_Shoe "Golden Horse Shoe") [Golden Horse Shoe](/wiki/Golden_Horse_Shoe "Golden Horse Shoe") and [(XVII - The Stars)](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "XVII - The Stars") [XVII - The Stars](/wiki/Cards_and_Runes "Cards and Runes") cards buffed by [(Tarot Cloth)](/wiki/Tarot_Cloth "Tarot Cloth") [Tarot Cloth](/wiki/Tarot_Cloth "Tarot Cloth").


Interactions
