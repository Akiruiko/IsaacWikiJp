 # Alabaster Box ![image](/image/Alabaster_Box.png) 


Effect
--------


* (Removed in Repentance) Isaac holds the Notched Axe above his head as long as he is in that [room](/wiki/Room "Room"), and can break any [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles") he touches, as well as being able to break through walls that lead into [Secret Rooms](/wiki/Secret_Room "Secret Room").
* (Added in Repentance) Isaac stops shooting tears and holds the Notched Axe like  [(The Forgotten)](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten") [The Forgotten](/wiki/The_Forgotten "The Forgotten")'s club, and can break [obstacles](/wiki/Obstacles "Obstacles"), blow open doors, and hit enemies for 3x damage by swinging it. The Notched Axe has 64 charges. Hitting rocks or opening doors depletes 1 charge for each obstacle destroyed. Hitting enemies depletes 2 charges. Isaac can toggle back and forth between tears and using the Notched Axe by pressing the Active Item button. Once the Notched Axe runs out of charges, it cannot be used for the rest of the [floor](/wiki/Floor "Floor").
* (Added in Repentance) The charges on Notched Axe cannot be refilled by means other than going to a new floor. This includes [Batteries](/wiki/Batteries "Batteries"), [Battery Bums](/wiki/Beggar#Battery_Bum "Beggar"), (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/4.5_Volt.png)](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt") [4.5 Volt](/wiki/4.5_Volt "4.5 Volt"), (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[![image](/image/Jumper_Cables.png)](/wiki/Jumper_Cables "Jumper Cables") [Jumper Cables](/wiki/Jumper_Cables "Jumper Cables"), etc.

Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Anti-Gravity.png)](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity") [Anti-Gravity](/wiki/Anti-Gravity "Anti-Gravity"): Melee attacks will generate a hovering tear in the shape of the swing of the pickaxe.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/The_Battery.png)](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery") [The Battery](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery"): Causes remaining charge from the previous floor to carry over to the next one.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany"): Breaking Notched Axe and using a Soul Charge to activate it again will allow for a single use before immediately breaking. However, Soul Charges are not consumed in the process, allowing for infinite use of Notched Axe. This also works with  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany")'s blood charges and is likely unintentional.
* (Added in Repentance) [![image](/image/The_Book_of_Belial.png)](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") [The Book of Belial](/wiki/The_Book_of_Belial "The Book of Belial") + [![image](/image/Birthright.png)](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") [Birthright](/wiki/Birthright "Birthright") as  [(Judas)](/wiki/Judas "Judas") [Judas](/wiki/Judas "Judas") /  [(Dark Judas)](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas") [Dark Judas](/wiki/Dark_Judas "Dark Judas"): The axe receives a purplish glow and receives the following upgrades:
	+ **Increased durability**: each use of the axe has a very high chance not to use a charge.
	+ **Faster usage**: the axe can be swung faster.
	+ **Higher knockback**: enemies are knocked back when hit, receiving *8 + 0.2 * floor* damage if they collide with a wall, obstacle, or other enemies.
	+ **Fire effect**: the axe will set enemies on fire. The burn damage is equal to Judas' damage.
	+ **Increased luck**: destroying obstacles with the axe has an increased chance to spawn pickups.
		- Destroying [Poops](/wiki/Poop "Poop") will spawn pickups much more frequently. When combined with [(Petrified Poop)](/wiki/Petrified_Poop "Petrified Poop") [Petrified Poop](/wiki/Petrified_Poop "Petrified Poop"), the chance becomes 100% and will often result in multiple pickups from a single poop.
		- Destroying [Tinted Rocks](/wiki/Tinted_Rock "Tinted Rock") will drop more consumables than usual, similarly to [Super Special Rocks](/wiki/Rocks#Super_Special_Rocks "Rocks").
		- Destroying [Urns](/wiki/Urn "Urn") has a higher chance to drop more coins. The coins can be of different variants, such as [Dimes](/wiki/Dime "Dime"), [Lucky Pennies](/wiki/Lucky_Penny "Lucky Penny"), [Golden Pennies](/wiki/Golden_Penny "Golden Penny"), etc.
		- Destroying [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushroom "Mushroom"), [Skulls](/wiki/Skull "Skull") and other alternative rock variants has an increased chance to drop their respective rewards.
		- Destroying [Fool's Gold](/wiki/Fool%27s_Gold "Fool's Gold") rocks will drop significantly more coins.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): When used with the Book of Virtues, breaking obstacles has a chance to generate wisps that have different effects based on the "mineral" mined, from most common to least common:

	+ Silver wisp: Fires metallic tears that have the effect of [![image](/image/Iron_Bar.png)](/wiki/Iron_Bar "Iron Bar") [Iron Bar](/wiki/Iron_Bar "Iron Bar") and deal 4 damage.
	+ Gold wisp: Fires penny tears that have the effect of turning enemies gold, similar to [![image](/image/Midas%27_Touch.png)](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") [Midas' Touch](/wiki/Midas%27_Touch "Midas' Touch") and deal 3.5 damage.
	+ Red wisp: Fires laser tears similar to the ones fired by [![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology") and deal 3.5 damage.
	+ Blue wisp: Fires diamond tears similar to the ones fired by [![image](/image/Crown_of_Light.png)](/wiki/Crown_of_Light "Crown of Light") [Crown of Light](/wiki/Crown_of_Light "Crown of Light") that deal 7 damage.

* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Ipecac.png)](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac") [Ipecac](/wiki/Ipecac "Ipecac"): Melee attacks will trigger an explosion when they makes contact with an enemy; unlike with the Forgotten's bone club, Isaac *will* take damage from these Ipecac explosions.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Technology.png)](/wiki/Technology "Technology") [Technology](/wiki/Technology "Technology"): Melee attacks will cause a technology laser ring to appear around Isaac, damaging enemies.


Interactions
