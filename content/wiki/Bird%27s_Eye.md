 # Bird's Eye ![image](/image/Bird%27s_Eye.png) 

Effects
---------


* Gives Isaac a chance to shoot fires alongside his regular tears that block enemy shots and deal damage to enemies that touch them, similar to those shot by [![image](/image/Red_Candle.png)](/wiki/Red_Candle "Red Candle") [Red Candle](/wiki/Red_Candle "Red Candle").
	+ Fires can block up to four shots and/or deal four ticks of damage before being destroyed, and last up to 10 seconds.
	+ Fires deal 4x Isaac's damage at full durability, 3x Isaac's damage after taking damage once, and 2x Isaac's damage otherwise, for a max possible damage output of 11x Isaac's damage per fire.
	+ Flames will destroy [shopkeepers](/wiki/Shopkeeper "Shopkeeper").
	+ The chance to shoot fires depends on Isaac's [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck") stat. The activation rate is equal to 1/(12 - Luck). At base luck (0), the chance is 8.33%, maxing out at 50% at 10 luck.
	+ The size of the flames depends on Isaac's damage.
	+ Any fart related effect that occurs will also generate a flame, like using [![image](/image/The_Poop.png)](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop") [The Poop](/wiki/The_Poop "The Poop") or when generating a bomb with [![image](/image/No._2.png)](/wiki/No._2 "Number Two") [Number Two](/wiki/No._2 "No. 2").


Synergies
-----------


* [![image](/image/Brimstone.png)](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone") [Brimstone](/wiki/Brimstone "Brimstone"): Will occasionally spawn a fire when firing and with high luck will spawn four fires.
* [![image](/image/Chocolate_Milk.png)](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk") [Chocolate Milk](/wiki/Chocolate_Milk "Chocolate Milk"): As each flame's damage is unaffected by the charge of each tear, a flame-thrower-like effect with very high damage can be achieved with a decent luck stat and rapidly fired low-charge tears.
* [![image](/image/Ghost_Pepper.png)](/wiki/Ghost_Pepper "Ghost Pepper") [Ghost Pepper](/wiki/Ghost_Pepper "Ghost Pepper"): Changes the activation rate to 1/(8 - Luck). At base luck (0), the chance is 12.5%, maxing out at 100% at 7 luck. Only one type of fire can be spawned at a time, however each flame has an equal chance of being launched.
* [![image](/image/The_Ludovico_Technique.png)](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique") [The Ludovico Technique](/wiki/The_Ludovico_Technique "The Ludovico Technique"): Will occasionally shoot fire from Isaac toward the floating tear.
* [![image](/image/Proptosis.png)](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis") [Proptosis](/wiki/Proptosis "Proptosis"): Size and damage of fires is increased, but does not decrease with range.
* [![image](/image/Urn_of_Souls.png)](/wiki/Urn_of_Souls "Urn of Souls") [Urn of Souls](/wiki/Urn_of_Souls "Urn of Souls"): Causes the Urn to emit Bird's Eye's red flames in addition to its regular flames.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/Lil_Dumpy.png)](/wiki/Lil_Dumpy "Lil Dumpy") [Lil Dumpy](/wiki/Lil_Dumpy "Lil Dumpy"): Every time Lil Dumpy farts, Isaac emits a flame too.
