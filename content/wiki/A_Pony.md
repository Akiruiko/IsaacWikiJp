 # A Pony ![image](/image/A_Pony.png) 

Effects
---------


* Passively gives [flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight") whether it has charges or not.
* If Isaac's [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") is less than 1.5, the item passively increases his speed to 1.5.
* Upon use, Isaac charges in the direction the pony is facing, giving invincibility during the charge and dealing contact damage to enemies.
	+ (Removed in Repentance) The dash deals 40 flat contact damage to enemies.
		- (Added in Repentance) The dash deals 4 times Isaac's damage, plus a flat 28 damage.
	+ While not time based, invincibility from A Pony is otherwise identical to damage immunity granted by the [invulnerability](/wiki/Invulnerability "Invulnerability") effect.


Notes
-------


* This item is normally only obtainable by defeating [The Headless Horseman](/wiki/The_Headless_Horseman "The Headless Horseman").
* The [flight](/wiki/Flight "Flight") and potential [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") added by A Pony will be removed if a new activated [item](/wiki/Item "Item") is collected.
* (Added in Afterbirth â€ ) If [![image](/image/Void.png)](/wiki/Void "Void") [Void](/wiki/Void "Void") is used, Isaac will not be granted permanent flight.
* (Added in Repentance) If Isaac dashes into an open door, he will continue to dash in that direction for a distance of 2 normal [rooms](/wiki/Rooms "Rooms") unless he collides with a closed door/wall.
	+ Dashing can be used to exit curse rooms, unharmed.
* Does NOT work in the fight against The Beast.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Book_of_Virtues.png)](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues") [Book of Virtues](/wiki/Book_of_Virtues "Book of Virtues"): Spawns wisps in the middle ring, looking like "A Pony". The wisps charge in the direction Isaac shoots instead of firing tears. While charging, the wisps deal contact damage equal to 40% of Isaac's damage per tick (120% of Isaac's damage per second) and are immune to damage. Wisps must wait 2.5 seconds after hitting a wall before they can charge again. The wisps deal their normal contact damage while not charging.
* (Added in Repentance)[![image](/image/Mars.png)](/wiki/Mars "Mars") [Mars](/wiki/Mars "Mars"): Lowers the dash cooldown to approximately 1 second.


Interactions
--------------


* (Added in Afterbirth)[![image](/image/Car_Battery.png)](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery") [Car Battery](/wiki/Car_Battery "Car Battery"): No effect.
