Effects[]
---------


* Damages Isaac in exchange for fully recharging Isaac's current activated item.
	+ Sharp Plug costs two hearts of health to use.

	+ (Removed in Repentance) If the item has any charges, the Sharp Plug will not work.


Notes[]
-------


* (Removed in Repentance) If Isaac has less than two Black or Soul Hearts, it will remove them but will not remove any Red Hearts.

* (Added in Repentance) Sharp Plug cannot deal fatal damage. If used at one half heart, it will not work.


Synergies[]
-----------


* (Added in Repentance) [Damage-triggered items](/wiki/Category:Damage-triggered_items "Category:Damage-triggered items"): Each half heart used up by activating Sharp Plug triggers damage effects separately, allowing multiple payouts.
* (Added in Afterbirth)[(Glowing Hour Glass)](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass") [Glowing Hour Glass](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass"): As long as Isaac has more than (Removed in Repentance) 2 full hearts or (Added in Repentance) 1.5 hearts, time can be rewinded indefinitely since the health used to recharge the item is refunded upon use.
* (Removed in Repentance)  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper"): The Keeper takes only one heart of damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Expends health for charges at the rate of 2 charges per 1 [Coin Heart](/wiki/Coin_Heart "Coin Heart"). If an item is 1-charge, removes 1 Coin Heart.
* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )[(Schoolbag)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag"): The active item in the main slot is fully charged as normal and the secondary slot gains as many charges as the main one did.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene"): Tainted Magdalene's [(Yum Heart)](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart") [Yum Heart](/wiki/Yum_Heart "Yum Heart") can be used infinitely, allowing for infinite invincibility frames from taking damage. Paired with Tainted Magdalene's melee attack, this can easily win a run.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(The Wafer)](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer") [The Wafer](/wiki/The_Wafer "The Wafer"): Reduces the health cost to half a heart (except for Keeper).


Interactions[]
--------------


* (Removed in Repentance) [(9 Volt)](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt") [9 Volt](/wiki/9_Volt "9 Volt"): Renders the Sharp Plug unusable. Sharp Plug can only be used if the item is at 0 charges, but 9 Volt instantly gives 1 charge to the item upon activation.
	+ (Added in Repentance) As Sharp Plug can now be used with charges and the cost is based on charges filled, 9 Volt now synergizes with Sharp Plug, lowering the cost of using it by half a heart on 2+ charge items.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Alabaster Box)](/wiki/Alabaster_Box "Alabaster Box") [Alabaster Box](/wiki/Alabaster_Box "Alabaster Box"): Expends up to 6 full hearts if possible with no charges given.
* (Added in Repentance) [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") /  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany"): Soul/blood charges are used before Sharp Plug when available.
* (Added in Repentance)[(Eraser)](/wiki/Eraser "Eraser") [Eraser](/wiki/Eraser "Eraser"): Attempting to recharge the Eraser with the Sharp Plug fails and only hurts Isaac for half a heart.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle"): Holy Mantle blocks the damage from Sharp Plug if the shield is active, but also keeps Isaac's active item from charging.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Bypasses the Holy Mantle and gives charges as usual.
* (Removed in Repentance) [(Isaac's Heart)](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Heart "Isaac's Heart") [Isaac's Heart](/wiki/Isaac%27s_Heart "Isaac's Heart"): Renders the Sharp Plug unusable.
* [(The Lost)](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost") [The Lost](/wiki/The_Lost "The Lost"): No benefit from this item unless he has a respawn item because his active item's charge will not refill if the [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") effect activates. Sharp Plug only activates upon receiving actual damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) No effect, as The Lost doesn't have health.
	+ (Added in Repentance) When turned into The Lost via the white fire, activating Sharp Plug will take the health cost from the original character's health. [(Holy Mantle)](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") [Holy Mantle](/wiki/Holy_Mantle "Holy Mantle") will not block the health cost.
* (Removed in Repentance) (Added in Afterbirth)[(Mega Blast)](/wiki/Mega_Blast "Mega Blast") [Mega Blast](/wiki/Mega_Blast "Mega Blast"): Sharp Plug will not work with Mega Blast.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Works as intended, giving 1 charge per half a heart.
