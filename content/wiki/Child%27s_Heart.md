 # Child's Heart ![image](/image/Child%27s_Heart.png) 

Effects
---------


* Gives a 10% chance of changing the room drop reward to a [heart](/wiki/Hearts "Hearts").
* Opening [chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests") and destroying [Tinted Rocks](/wiki/Tinted_Rock "Tinted Rock"), [Slot Machines](/wiki/Slot_Machine "Slot Machine") or [Fortune Telling Machines](/wiki/Fortune_Telling_Machine "Fortune Telling Machine") have a chance of adding a heart to the rewards.


Notes
-------


* (Added in Afterbirth â€ )  [(Samson)](/wiki/Samson "Samson") [Samson](/wiki/Samson "Samson") will start with Child's Heart after completing [Ultra Hard](/wiki/Ultra_Hard "Ultra Hard").
* Since the increase of heart drops come at the expense of other [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups"), if Isaac is short on pickups such as keys and bombs, dropping the trinket by holding the 'Drop' key (default: control) may be beneficial.
