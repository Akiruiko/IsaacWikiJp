 # Holy Water ![image](/image/Holy_Water.png) 

Effect
--------


* (Removed in Repentance) Spawns a [familiar](/wiki/Familiar "Familiar") that follows Isaac. If Isaac takes damage, it will shatter and create a pool of damaging [blue creep](/wiki/Blue_creep "Blue creep"), similar to [![image](/image/Lemon_Mishap.png)](/wiki/Lemon_Mishap "Lemon Mishap") [Lemon Mishap](/wiki/Lemon_Mishap "Lemon Mishap").
	+ The pool lasts for ~9 seconds and deals 8 damage per tick to non-flying enemies (24 damage per second).
	+ After breaking, Holy Water will reappear in the next room.
* (Added in Repentance) Spawns a familiar that follows Isaac and launches itself in the direction Isaac shoots. Upon hitting an enemy, it will deal 7 damage and shatter, creating a pool of damaging [blue creep](/wiki/Blue_creep "Blue creep") that also [petrifies](/wiki/Petrification "Petrification") enemies that touch it.
	+ Once the pool disappears completely, Holy Water will respawn and can be fired again. Holy Water does not immediately respawn upon entering a new room.


Interactions
--------------


* [![image](/image/BFFS!.png)](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!") [BFFS!](/wiki/BFFS! "BFFS!"): Familiar is bigger but no effect on damage.
	+ (Added in Repentance) Doubles the initial damage and causes it to also spawn a blue flame on point of impact that blocks shots and deals 6 contact damage per tick to enemies (36 damage per second). The fire can hit flying enemies, persists for the same amount of time as the creep, and cannot be destroyed.
