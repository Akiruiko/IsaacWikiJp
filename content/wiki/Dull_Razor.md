Effects[]
---------


* Taking damage causes Isaac to release a ring of 10 tears and gain [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears") up for the current room.
	+ The first hit taken increases Isaac's tears fired per second by 1.2, then by 0.4 for every subsequent hit in the same room. This ignores the tears cap and can stack indefinitely.
	+ Each tear in the ring deals 10 damage and doesn't use Isaac's tear effects.
