 # Mom's Locket ![image](/image/Mom%27s_Locket.png) 

Effects
---------


* Grants half a [red heart](/wiki/Health#Red_Heart_Containers "Health") each time a [key](/wiki/Key "Key") is used to unlock a door, [golden chest](/wiki/Chests#Golden_Chest "Chests"), or key block.
* Turns [half red heart](/wiki/Hearts#Half_Red_Heart "Hearts") [pickups](/wiki/Pickups "Pickups") into [full hearts](/wiki/Hearts#Red_Heart "Hearts"). Half hearts already on the ground will also be upgraded upon re-entering the room.


Notes
-------


* Having a [Golden Key](/wiki/Golden_Key "Golden Key") or [![image](/image/Paper_Clip.png)](/wiki/Paper_Clip "Paper Clip") [Paper Clip](/wiki/Paper_Clip "Paper Clip") will render the trinket unable to grant half hearts from keys.
* Having Mom's Locket while playing  [(Keeper)](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Keeper](/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") will restore a full health coin when a key is used.
* Donating keys to a [Key Master](/wiki/Key_Master "Key Master") won't heal Isaac.
* A very useful trinket for unlocking the (Added in Afterbirth †)[(It's the Key)](/wiki/Ace_of_Spades_(Card) "It's the Key") [It's the Key](/wiki/Ace_of_Spades_(Card) "Ace of Spades (Card)") achievement, in which Isaac cannot pick up coins, bombs, and most importantly hearts.
* (Added in Repentance) Hearts dropped from  [(Tainted Magdalene)](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene") [Tainted Magdalene](/wiki/Tainted_Magdalene "Tainted Magdalene")'s mechanic will be always full red hearts.
* (Added in Repentance) With  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") grants a blood charge upon using a key.


Synergies
-----------


* (Added in Afterbirth †)[![image](/image/Equality!.png)](/wiki/Equality! "Equality!") [Equality!](/wiki/Equality! "Equality!"): As long as Equality is active, *all* red hearts will be double.


* [(Humbling Bundle)](/wiki/Humbling_Bundle "Humbling Bundle") [Humbling Bundle](/wiki/Humbling_Bundle "Humbling Bundle"): Humbling Bundle cannot alter half red hearts, but Mom's Locket turns them into full red hearts, which it can double.
