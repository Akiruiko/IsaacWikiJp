Effects
---------


* Increases all [stats](/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") while Isaac's active item is fully charged:
	+ +0.25 [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed").
	+ +0.75 [range](/wiki/Range "Range").
	+ +0.20 [tears](/wiki/Tears "Tears").
	+ +0.10 [shot speed](/wiki/Shot_speed "Shot speed").
	+ +0.50 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage").
	+ +1 [luck](/wiki/Luck "Luck").


Notes
-------


* The trinket creates no effect if Isaac has no active item.
* (Removed in Repentance) Active items that are reusable indefinitely without a charge bar, such as [(How to Jump)](/wiki/How_to_Jump "How to Jump") [How to Jump](/wiki/How_to_Jump "How to Jump"), will allow Vibrant Bulb's effects to be permanent (until the active item is swapped out).
* Vibrant Bulb is slightly less than half as powerful as [![image](/image/Dim_Bulb.png)](/wiki/Dim_Bulb "Dim Bulb") [Dim Bulb](/wiki/Dim_Bulb "Dim Bulb"); however, its effects are active more often.
* [(Glowing Hour Glass)](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass") [Glowing Hour Glass](/wiki/Glowing_Hour_Glass "Glowing Hour Glass"), when used, will not make the Vibrant Bulb inactive and will still provide the bonus until it has one bar of charge.
* Having additional charge beyond full with [(The Battery)](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery") [The Battery](/wiki/The_Battery "The Battery") does not provide an additional bonus. It does give an advantage however, since using the fully charged item once still provides Vibrant Bulb's effect.
* If two active items are held ([(Schoolbag)](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag") [Schoolbag](/wiki/Schoolbag "Schoolbag")), the one currently active must be at full charge for the trinket to take effect (the other one doesn't need to be fully charged).
* (Added in Repentance) Vibrant Bulb produces no effect with active items in consumable slots, e.g.  [(Tainted Apollyon)](/wiki/Tainted_Apollyon "Tainted Apollyon") [Tainted Apollyon](/wiki/Tainted_Apollyon "Tainted Apollyon")'s [(Abyss)](/wiki/Abyss "Abyss") [Abyss](/wiki/Abyss "Abyss") or  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany")'s [(Lemegeton)](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton") [Lemegeton](/wiki/Lemegeton "Lemegeton").
* (Added in Repentance) If  [(Bethany)](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") [Bethany](/wiki/Bethany "Bethany") or  [(Tainted Bethany)](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") [Tainted Bethany](/wiki/Tainted_Bethany "Tainted Bethany") are holding enough soul/red hearts to charge her current active item, the Vibrant Bulb will be active, even if there are no regular charges.
	+ If the active item is fully charged only with soul/blood charges and no regular charges, Vibrant Bulb and Dim Bulb can be both active at the same time if Isaac holds both of the trinkets.


Bugs
------




| (Bug) Bug!
 | Replacing Isaac's active item with another active item that doesn't have a charge bar won't immediately activate the trinket's effects. The effect will depend on whether or not the previous item had a full charge or not. Furthermore, if the effect is active due to the previous item having a full charge, picking up a different active item that currently has no charge won't disable the effect, and vice-versa.
